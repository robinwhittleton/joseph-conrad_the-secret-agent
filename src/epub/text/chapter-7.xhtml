<p>The Assistant Commissioner walked along a short and narrow
street like a wet, muddy trench, then crossing a very broad
thoroughfare entered a public edifice, and sought speech with a
young private secretary (unpaid) of a great personage.</p>
<p>This fair, smooth-faced young man, whose symmetrically
arranged hair gave him the air of a large and neat schoolboy, met
the Assistant Commissioner&rsquo;s request with a doubtful look,
and spoke with bated breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would he see you?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know about
that.&nbsp; He has walked over from the House an hour ago to talk
with the permanent Under-Secretary, and now he&rsquo;s ready to
walk back again.&nbsp; He might have sent for him; but he does it
for the sake of a little exercise, I suppose.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
all the exercise he can find time for while this session
lasts.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t complain; I rather enjoy these little
strolls.&nbsp; He leans on my arm, and doesn&rsquo;t open his
lips.&nbsp; But, I say, he&rsquo;s very tired,
and&mdash;well&mdash;not in the sweetest of tempers just
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in connection with that Greenwich
affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I say!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s very bitter against
you people.&nbsp; But I will go and see, if you
insist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a good fellow,&rdquo; said the
Assistant Commissioner.</p>
<p>The unpaid secretary admired this pluck.&nbsp; Composing for
himself an innocent face, he opened a door, and went in with the
assurance of a nice and privileged child.&nbsp; And presently he
reappeared, with a nod to the Assistant Commissioner, who passing
through the same door left open for him, found himself with the
great personage in a large room.</p>
<p>Vast in bulk and stature, with a long white face, which,
broadened at the base by a big double chin, appeared egg-shaped
in the fringe of thin greyish whisker, the great personage seemed
an expanding man.&nbsp; Unfortunate from a tailoring point of
view, the cross-folds in the middle of a buttoned black coat
added to the impression, as if the fastenings of the garment were
tried to the utmost.&nbsp; From the head, set upward on a thick
neck, the eyes, with puffy lower lids, stared with a haughty
droop on each side of a hooked aggressive nose, nobly salient in
the vast pale circumference of the face.&nbsp; A shiny silk hat
and a pair of worn gloves lying ready on the end of a long table
looked expanded too, enormous.</p>
<p>He stood on the hearthrug in big, roomy boots, and uttered no
word of greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to know if this is the beginning of
another dynamite campaign,&rdquo; he asked at once in a deep,
very smooth voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go into
details.&nbsp; I have no time for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner&rsquo;s figure before this big and
rustic Presence had the frail slenderness of a reed addressing
an oak.&nbsp; And indeed the unbroken record of that man&rsquo;s
descent surpassed in the number of centuries the age of the
oldest oak in the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; As far as one can be positive about anything
I can assure you that it is not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; But your idea of assurances over
there,&rdquo; said the great man, with a contemptuous wave of his
hand towards a window giving on the broad thoroughfare,
&ldquo;seems to consist mainly in making the Secretary of State
look a fool.&nbsp; I have been told positively in this very room
less than a month ago that nothing of the sort was even
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner glanced in the direction of the
window calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will allow me to remark, Sir Ethelred, that so far
I have had no opportunity to give you assurances of any
kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The haughty droop of the eyes was focussed now upon the
Assistant Commissioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; confessed the deep, smooth voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I sent for Heat.&nbsp; You are still rather a novice in
your new berth.&nbsp; And how are you getting on over
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I am learning something every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course.&nbsp; I hope you will get
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Sir Ethelred.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve learned
something to-day, and even within the last hour or so.&nbsp;
There is much in this affair of a kind that does not meet the eye
in a usual anarchist outrage, even if one looked into it as deep
as can be.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great man put his arms akimbo, the backs of his big hands
resting on his hips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; Go on.&nbsp; Only no details,
pray.&nbsp; Spare me the details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not be troubled with them, Sir
Ethelred,&rdquo; the Assistant Commissioner began, with a calm
and untroubled assurance.&nbsp; While he was speaking the hands
on the face of the clock behind the great man&rsquo;s
back&mdash;a heavy, glistening affair of massive scrolls in the
same dark marble as the mantelpiece, and with a ghostly,
evanescent tick&mdash;had moved through the space of seven
minutes.&nbsp; He spoke with a studious fidelity to a
parenthetical manner, into which every little fact&mdash;that is,
every detail&mdash;fitted with delightful ease.&nbsp; Not a
murmur nor even a movement hinted at interruption.&nbsp; The
great Personage might have been the statue of one of his own
princely ancestors stripped of a crusader&rsquo;s war harness,
and put into an ill-fitting frock coat.&nbsp; The Assistant
Commissioner felt as though he were at liberty to talk for an
hour.&nbsp; But he kept his head, and at the end of the time
mentioned above he broke off with a sudden conclusion, which,
reproducing the opening statement, pleasantly surprised Sir
Ethelred by its apparent swiftness and force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kind of thing which meets us under the surface of
this affair, otherwise without gravity, is unusual&mdash;in this
precise form at least&mdash;and requires special
treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone of Sir Ethelred was deepened, full of conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so&mdash;involving the Ambassador of a
foreign power!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; The Ambassador!&rdquo; protested the other,
erect and slender, allowing himself a mere half smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It would be stupid of me to advance anything of the
kind.&nbsp; And it is absolutely unnecessary, because if I am
right in my surmises, whether ambassador or hall porter
it&rsquo;s a mere detail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Ethelred opened a wide mouth, like a cavern, into which
the hooked nose seemed anxious to peer; there came from it a
subdued rolling sound, as from a distant organ with the scornful
indignation stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; These people are too impossible.&nbsp; What
do they mean by importing their methods of Crim-Tartary
here?&nbsp; A Turk would have more decency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget, Sir Ethelred, that strictly speaking we
know nothing positively&mdash;as yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; But how would you define it?&nbsp;
Shortly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barefaced audacity amounting to childishness of a
peculiar sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t put up with the innocence of nasty
little children,&rdquo; said the great and expanded personage,
expanding a little more, as it were.&nbsp; The haughty drooping
glance struck crushingly the carpet at the Assistant
Commissioner&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to get
a hard rap on the knuckles over this affair.&nbsp; We must be in
a position to&mdash;What is your general idea, stated
shortly?&nbsp; No need to go into details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sir Ethelred.&nbsp; In principle, I should lay it
down that the existence of secret agents should not be tolerated,
as tending to augment the positive dangers of the evil against
which they are used.&nbsp; That the spy will fabricate his
information is a mere commonplace.&nbsp; But in the sphere of
political and revolutionary action, relying partly on violence,
the professional spy has every facility to fabricate the very
facts themselves, and will spread the double evil of emulation in
one direction, and of panic, hasty legislation, unreflecting
hate, on the other.&nbsp; However, this is an imperfect
world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deep-voiced Presence on the hearthrug, motionless, with
big elbows stuck out, said hastily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be lucid, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir Ethelred&mdash;An imperfect world.&nbsp;
Therefore directly the character of this affair suggested itself
to me, I thought it should be dealt with with special secrecy,
and ventured to come over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; approved the great
Personage, glancing down complacently over his double chin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am glad there&rsquo;s somebody over at your shop who
thinks that the Secretary of State may be trusted now and
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner had an amused smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was really thinking that it might be better at this
stage for Heat to be replaced by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; Heat?&nbsp; An ass&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
exclaimed the great man, with distinct animosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; Pray, Sir Ethelred, don&rsquo;t put
that unjust interpretation on my remarks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what?&nbsp; Too clever by half?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither&mdash;at least not as a rule.&nbsp; All the
grounds of my surmises I have from him.&nbsp; The only thing
I&rsquo;ve discovered by myself is that he has been making use of
that man privately.&nbsp; Who could blame him?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
an old police hand.&nbsp; He told me virtually that he must have
tools to work with.&nbsp; It occurred to me that this tool should
be surrendered to the Special Crimes division as a whole, instead
of remaining the private property of Chief Inspector Heat.&nbsp;
I extend my conception of our departmental duties to the
suppression of the secret agent.&nbsp; But Chief Inspector Heat
is an old departmental hand.&nbsp; He would accuse me of
perverting its morality and attacking its efficiency.&nbsp; He
would define it bitterly as protection extended to the criminal
class of revolutionists.&nbsp; It would mean just that to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; But what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to say, first, that there&rsquo;s but poor
comfort in being able to declare that any given act of
violence&mdash;damaging property or destroying life&mdash;is not
the work of anarchism at all, but of something else
altogether&mdash;some species of authorised scoundrelism.&nbsp;
This, I fancy, is much more frequent than we suppose.&nbsp; Next,
it&rsquo;s obvious that the existence of these people in the pay
of foreign governments destroys in a measure the efficiency of
our supervision.&nbsp; A spy of that sort can afford to be more
reckless than the most reckless of conspirators.&nbsp; His
occupation is free from all restraint.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s without
as much faith as is necessary for complete negation, and without
that much law as is implied in lawlessness.&nbsp; Thirdly, the
existence of these spies amongst the revolutionary groups, which
we are reproached for harbouring here, does away with all
certitude.&nbsp; You have received a reassuring statement from
Chief Inspector Heat some time ago.&nbsp; It was by no means
groundless&mdash;and yet this episode happens.&nbsp; I call it an
episode, because this affair, I make bold to say, is episodic; it
is no part of any general scheme, however wild.&nbsp; The very
peculiarities which surprise and perplex Chief Inspector Heat
establish its character in my eyes.&nbsp; I am keeping clear of
details, Sir Ethelred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Personage on the hearthrug had been listening with
profound attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so.&nbsp; Be as concise as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner intimated by an earnest deferential
gesture that he was anxious to be concise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a peculiar stupidity and feebleness in the
conduct of this affair which gives me excellent hopes of getting
behind it and finding there something else than an individual
freak of fanaticism.&nbsp; For it is a planned thing,
undoubtedly.&nbsp; The actual perpetrator seems to have been led
by the hand to the spot, and then abandoned hurriedly to his own
devices.&nbsp; The inference is that he was imported from abroad
for the purpose of committing this outrage.&nbsp; At the same
time one is forced to the conclusion that he did not know enough
English to ask his way, unless one were to accept the fantastic
theory that he was a deaf mute.&nbsp; I wonder now&mdash;But this
is idle.&nbsp; He has destroyed himself by an accident,
obviously.&nbsp; Not an extraordinary accident.&nbsp; But an
extraordinary little fact remains: the address on his clothing
discovered by the merest accident, too.&nbsp; It is an incredible
little fact, so incredible that the explanation which will
account for it is bound to touch the bottom of this affair.&nbsp;
Instead of instructing Heat to go on with this case, my intention
is to seek this explanation personally&mdash;by myself, I
mean&mdash;where it may be picked up.&nbsp; That is in a certain
shop in Brett Street, and on the lips of a certain secret agent
once upon a time the confidential and trusted spy of the late
Baron Stott-Wartenheim, Ambassador of a Great Power to the Court
of St James.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner paused, then added: &ldquo;Those
fellows are a perfect pest.&rdquo;&nbsp; In order to raise his
drooping glance to the speaker&rsquo;s face, the Personage on the
hearthrug had gradually tilted his head farther back, which gave
him an aspect of extraordinary haughtiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not leave it to Heat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he is an old departmental hand.&nbsp; They have
their own morality.&nbsp; My line of inquiry would appear to him
an awful perversion of duty.&nbsp; For him the plain duty is to
fasten the guilt upon as many prominent anarchists as he can on
some slight indications he had picked up in the course of his
investigation on the spot; whereas I, he would say, am bent upon
vindicating their innocence.&nbsp; I am trying to be as lucid as
I can in presenting this obscure matter to you without
details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would, would he?&rdquo; muttered the proud head of
Sir Ethelred from its lofty elevation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid so&mdash;with an indignation and disgust of
which you or I can have no idea.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s an excellent
servant.&nbsp; We must not put an undue strain on his
loyalty.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s always a mistake.&nbsp; Besides, I
want a free hand&mdash;a freer hand than it would be perhaps
advisable to give Chief Inspector Heat.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t the
slightest wish to spare this man Verloc.&nbsp; He will, I
imagine, be extremely startled to find his connection with this
affair, whatever it may be, brought home to him so quickly.&nbsp;
Frightening him will not be very difficult.&nbsp; But our true
objective lies behind him somewhere.&nbsp; I want your authority
to give him such assurances of personal safety as I may think
proper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the Personage on the
hearthrug.&nbsp; &ldquo;Find out as much as you can; find it out
in your own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must set about it without loss of time, this very
evening,&rdquo; said the Assistant Commissioner.</p>
<p>Sir Ethelred shifted one hand under his coat tails, and
tilting back his head, looked at him steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a late sitting to-night,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come to the House with your discoveries if we
are not gone home.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll warn Toodles to look out for
you.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll take you into my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The numerous family and the wide connections of the
youthful-looking Private Secretary cherished for him the hope of
an austere and exalted destiny.&nbsp; Meantime the social sphere
he adorned in his hours of idleness chose to pet him under the
above nickname.&nbsp; And Sir Ethelred, hearing it on the lips of
his wife and girls every day (mostly at breakfast-time), had
conferred upon it the dignity of unsmiling adoption.</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner was surprised and gratified
extremely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall certainly bring my discoveries to the House on
the chance of you having the time to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have the time,&rdquo; interrupted the
great Personage.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I will see you.&nbsp; I
haven&rsquo;t the time now&mdash;And you are going
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir Ethelred.&nbsp; I think it the best
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Personage had tilted his head so far back that, in order
to keep the Assistant Commissioner under his observation, he had
to nearly close his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; And how do you
propose&mdash;Will you assume a disguise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly a disguise!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll change my clothes,
of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; repeated the great man, with a sort
of absent-minded loftiness.&nbsp; He turned his big head slowly,
and over his shoulder gave a haughty oblique stare to the
ponderous marble timepiece with the sly, feeble tick.&nbsp; The
gilt hands had taken the opportunity to steal through no less
than five and twenty minutes behind his back.</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner, who could not see them, grew a
little nervous in the interval.&nbsp; But the great man presented
to him a calm and undismayed face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, and paused, as if in
deliberate contempt of the official clock.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what
first put you in motion in this direction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been always of opinion,&rdquo; began the
Assistant Commissioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Opinion.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s of
course.&nbsp; But the immediate motive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I say, Sir Ethelred?&nbsp; A new man&rsquo;s
antagonism to old methods.&nbsp; A desire to know something at
first hand.&nbsp; Some impatience.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my old work,
but the harness is different.&nbsp; It has been chafing me a
little in one or two tender places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll get on over there,&rdquo; said the
great man kindly, extending his hand, soft to the touch, but
broad and powerful like the hand of a glorified farmer.&nbsp; The
Assistant Commissioner shook it, and withdrew.</p>
<p>In the outer room Toodles, who had been waiting perched on the
edge of a table, advanced to meet him, subduing his natural
buoyancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&nbsp; Satisfactory?&rdquo; he asked, with airy
importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve earned my undying
gratitude,&rdquo; answered the Assistant Commissioner, whose long
face looked wooden in contrast with the peculiar character of the
other&rsquo;s gravity, which seemed perpetually ready to break
into ripples and chuckles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; But seriously, you
can&rsquo;t imagine how irritated he is by the attacks on his
Bill for the Nationalisation of Fisheries.&nbsp; They call it the
beginning of social revolution.&nbsp; Of course, it is a
revolutionary measure.&nbsp; But these fellows have no
decency.&nbsp; The personal attacks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read the papers,&rdquo; remarked the Assistant
Commissioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odious?&nbsp; Eh?&nbsp; And you have no notion what a
mass of work he has got to get through every day.&nbsp; He does
it all himself.&nbsp; Seems unable to trust anyone with these
Fisheries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet he&rsquo;s given a whole half hour to the
consideration of my very small sprat,&rdquo; interjected the
Assistant Commissioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small!&nbsp; Is it?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad to hear
that.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a pity you didn&rsquo;t keep away,
then.&nbsp; This fight takes it out of him frightfully.&nbsp; The
man&rsquo;s getting exhausted.&nbsp; I feel it by the way he
leans on my arm as we walk over.&nbsp; And, I say, is he safe in
the streets?&nbsp; Mullins has been marching his men up here this
afternoon.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a constable stuck by every
lamp-post, and every second person we meet between this and
Palace Yard is an obvious &lsquo;tec.&rsquo;&nbsp; It will get on
his nerves presently.&nbsp; I say, these foreign scoundrels
aren&rsquo;t likely to throw something at him&mdash;are
they?&nbsp; It would be a national calamity.&nbsp; The country
can&rsquo;t spare him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to mention yourself.&nbsp; He leans on your
arm,&rdquo; suggested the Assistant Commissioner soberly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You would both go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be an easy way for a young man to go down into
history?&nbsp; Not so many British Ministers have been
assassinated as to make it a minor incident.&nbsp; But seriously
now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that if you want to go down into history
you&rsquo;ll have to do something for it.&nbsp; Seriously,
there&rsquo;s no danger whatever for both of you but from
overwork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sympathetic Toodles welcomed this opening for a
chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fisheries won&rsquo;t kill me.&nbsp; I am used to
late hours,&rdquo; he declared, with ingenuous levity.&nbsp; But,
feeling an instant compunction, he began to assume an air of
statesman-like moodiness, as one draws on a glove.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His massive intellect will stand any amount of work.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s his nerves that I am afraid of.&nbsp; The reactionary
gang, with that abusive brute Cheeseman at their head, insult him
every night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he will insist on beginning a revolution!&rdquo;
murmured the Assistant Commissioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time has come, and he is the only man great enough
for the work,&rdquo; protested the revolutionary Toodles, flaring
up under the calm, speculative gaze of the Assistant
Commissioner.&nbsp; Somewhere in a corridor a distant bell
tinkled urgently, and with devoted vigilance the young man
pricked up his ears at the sound.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s ready
to go now,&rdquo; he exclaimed in a whisper, snatched up his hat,
and vanished from the room.</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner went out by another door in a less
elastic manner.&nbsp; Again he crossed the wide thoroughfare,
walked along a narrow street, and re-entered hastily his own
departmental buildings.&nbsp; He kept up this accelerated pace to
the door of his private room.&nbsp; Before he had closed it
fairly his eyes sought his desk.&nbsp; He stood still for a
moment, then walked up, looked all round on the floor, sat down
in his chair, rang a bell, and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief Inspector Heat gone yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; Went away half-an-hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;That will do.&rdquo;&nbsp; And sitting
still, with his hat pushed off his forehead, he thought that it
was just like Heat&rsquo;s confounded cheek to carry off quietly
the only piece of material evidence.&nbsp; But he thought this
without animosity.&nbsp; Old and valued servants will take
liberties.&nbsp; The piece of overcoat with the address sewn on
was certainly not a thing to leave about.&nbsp; Dismissing from
his mind this manifestation of Chief Inspector Heat&rsquo;s
mistrust, he wrote and despatched a note to his wife, charging
her to make his apologies to Michaelis&rsquo; great lady, with
whom they were engaged to dine that evening.</p>
<p>The short jacket and the low, round hat he assumed in a sort
of curtained alcove containing a washstand, a row of wooden pegs
and a shelf, brought out wonderfully the length of his grave,
brown face.&nbsp; He stepped back into the full light of the
room, looking like the vision of a cool, reflective Don Quixote,
with the sunken eyes of a dark enthusiast and a very deliberate
manner.&nbsp; He left the scene of his daily labours quickly like
an unobtrusive shadow.&nbsp; His descent into the street was like
the descent into a slimy aquarium from which the water had been
run off.&nbsp; A murky, gloomy dampness enveloped him.&nbsp; The
walls of the houses were wet, the mud of the roadway glistened
with an effect of phosphorescence, and when he emerged into the
Strand out of a narrow street by the side of Charing Cross
Station the genius of the locality assimilated him.&nbsp; He
might have been but one more of the queer foreign fish that can
be seen of an evening about there flitting round the dark
corners.</p>
<p>He came to a stand on the very edge of the pavement, and
waited.&nbsp; His exercised eyes had made out in the confused
movements of lights and shadows thronging the roadway the
crawling approach of a hansom.&nbsp; He gave no sign; but when
the low step gliding along the curbstone came to his feet he
dodged in skilfully in front of the big turning wheel, and spoke
up through the little trap door almost before the man gazing
supinely ahead from his perch was aware of having been boarded by
a fare.</p>
<p>It was not a long drive.&nbsp; It ended by signal abruptly,
nowhere in particular, between two lamp-posts before a large
drapery establishment&mdash;a long range of shops already lapped
up in sheets of corrugated iron for the night.&nbsp; Tendering a
coin through the trap door the fare slipped out and away, leaving
an effect of uncanny, eccentric ghastliness upon the
driver&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; But the size of the coin was
satisfactory to his touch, and his education not being literary,
he remained untroubled by the fear of finding it presently turned
to a dead leaf in his pocket.&nbsp; Raised above the world of
fares by the nature of his calling, he contemplated their actions
with a limited interest.&nbsp; The sharp pulling of his horse
right round expressed his philosophy.</p>
<p>Meantime the Assistant Commissioner was already giving his
order to a waiter in a little Italian restaurant round the
corner&mdash;one of those traps for the hungry, long and narrow,
baited with a perspective of mirrors and white napery; without
air, but with an atmosphere of their own&mdash;an atmosphere of
fraudulent cookery mocking an abject mankind in the most pressing
of its miserable necessities.&nbsp; In this immoral atmosphere
the Assistant Commissioner, reflecting upon his enterprise,
seemed to lose some more of his identity.&nbsp; He had a sense of
loneliness, of evil freedom.&nbsp; It was rather pleasant.&nbsp;
When, after paying for his short meal, he stood up and waited for
his change, he saw himself in the sheet of glass, and was struck
by his foreign appearance.&nbsp; He contemplated his own image
with a melancholy and inquisitive gaze, then by sudden
inspiration raised the collar of his jacket.&nbsp; This
arrangement appeared to him commendable, and he completed it by
giving an upward twist to the ends of his black moustache.&nbsp;
He was satisfied by the subtle modification of his personal
aspect caused by these small changes.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll
do very well,&rdquo; he thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a
little wet, a little splashed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He became aware of the waiter at his elbow and of a small pile
of silver coins on the edge of the table before him.&nbsp; The
waiter kept one eye on it, while his other eye followed the long
back of a tall, not very young girl, who passed up to a distant
table looking perfectly sightless and altogether
unapproachable.&nbsp; She seemed to be a habitual customer.</p>
<p>On going out the Assistant Commissioner made to himself the
observation that the patrons of the place had lost in the
frequentation of fraudulent cookery all their national and
private characteristics.&nbsp; And this was strange, since the
Italian restaurant is such a peculiarly British
institution.&nbsp; But these people were as denationalised as the
dishes set before them with every circumstance of unstamped
respectability.&nbsp; Neither was their personality stamped in
any way, professionally, socially or racially.&nbsp; They seemed
created for the Italian restaurant, unless the Italian restaurant
had been perchance created for them.&nbsp; But that last
hypothesis was unthinkable, since one could not place them
anywhere outside those special establishments.&nbsp; One never
met these enigmatical persons elsewhere.&nbsp; It was impossible
to form a precise idea what occupations they followed by day and
where they went to bed at night.&nbsp; And he himself had become
unplaced.&nbsp; It would have been impossible for anybody to
guess his occupation.&nbsp; As to going to bed, there was a doubt
even in his own mind.&nbsp; Not indeed in regard to his domicile
itself, but very much so in respect of the time when he would be
able to return there.&nbsp; A pleasurable feeling of independence
possessed him when he heard the glass doors swing to behind his
back with a sort of imperfect baffled thud.&nbsp; He advanced at
once into an immensity of greasy slime and damp plaster
interspersed with lamps, and enveloped, oppressed, penetrated,
choked, and suffocated by the blackness of a wet London night,
which is composed of soot and drops of water.</p>
<p>Brett Street was not very far away.&nbsp; It branched off,
narrow, from the side of an open triangular space surrounded by
dark and mysterious houses, temples of petty commerce emptied of
traders for the night.&nbsp; Only a fruiterer&rsquo;s stall at
the corner made a violent blaze of light and colour.&nbsp; Beyond
all was black, and the few people passing in that direction
vanished at one stride beyond the glowing heaps of oranges and
lemons.&nbsp; No footsteps echoed.&nbsp; They would never be
heard of again.&nbsp; The adventurous head of the Special Crimes
Department watched these disappearances from a distance with an
interested eye.&nbsp; He felt light-hearted, as though he had
been ambushed all alone in a jungle many thousands of miles away
from departmental desks and official inkstands.&nbsp; This
joyousness and dispersion of thought before a task of some
importance seems to prove that this world of ours is not such a
very serious affair after all.&nbsp; For the Assistant
Commissioner was not constitutionally inclined to levity.</p>
<p>The policeman on the beat projected his sombre and moving form
against the luminous glory of oranges and lemons, and entered
Brett Street without haste.&nbsp; The Assistant Commissioner, as
though he were a member of the criminal classes, lingered out of
sight, awaiting his return.&nbsp; But this constable seemed to be
lost for ever to the force.&nbsp; He never returned: must have
gone out at the other end of Brett Street.</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner, reaching this conclusion, entered
the street in his turn, and came upon a large van arrested in
front of the dimly lit window-panes of a carter&rsquo;s
eating-house.&nbsp; The man was refreshing himself inside, and
the horses, their big heads lowered to the ground, fed out of
nose-bags steadily.&nbsp; Farther on, on the opposite side of the
street, another suspect patch of dim light issued from Mr
Verloc&rsquo;s shop front, hung with papers, heaving with vague
piles of cardboard boxes and the shapes of books.&nbsp; The
Assistant Commissioner stood observing it across the
roadway.&nbsp; There could be no mistake.&nbsp; By the side of
the front window, encumbered by the shadows of nondescript
things, the door, standing ajar, let escape on the pavement a
narrow, clear streak of gas-light within.</p>
<p>Behind the Assistant Commissioner the van and horses, merged
into one mass, seemed something alive&mdash;a square-backed black
monster blocking half the street, with sudden iron-shod
stampings, fierce jingles, and heavy, blowing sighs.&nbsp; The
harshly festive, ill-omened glare of a large and prosperous
public-house faced the other end of Brett Street across a wide
road.&nbsp; This barrier of blazing lights, opposing the shadows
gathered about the humble abode of Mr Verloc&rsquo;s domestic
happiness, seemed to drive the obscurity of the street back upon
itself, make it more sullen, brooding, and sinister.</p>
