<p>Having infused by persistent importunities some sort of heat
into the chilly interest of several licensed victuallers (the
acquaintances once upon a time of her late unlucky husband), Mrs
Verloc&rsquo;s mother had at last secured her admission to
certain almshouses founded by a wealthy innkeeper for the
destitute widows of the trade.</p>
<p>This end, conceived in the astuteness of her uneasy heart, the
old woman had pursued with secrecy and determination.&nbsp; That
was the time when her daughter Winnie could not help passing a
remark to Mr Verloc that &ldquo;mother has been spending
half-crowns and five shillings almost every day this last week in
cab fares.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the remark was not made
grudgingly.&nbsp; Winnie respected her mother&rsquo;s
infirmities.&nbsp; She was only a little surprised at this sudden
mania for locomotion.&nbsp; Mr Verloc, who was sufficiently
magnificent in his way, had grunted the remark impatiently aside
as interfering with his meditations.&nbsp; These were frequent,
deep, and prolonged; they bore upon a matter more important than
five shillings.&nbsp; Distinctly more important, and beyond all
comparison more difficult to consider in all its aspects with
philosophical serenity.</p>
<p>Her object attained in astute secrecy, the heroic old woman
had made a clean breast of it to Mrs Verloc.&nbsp; Her soul was
triumphant and her heart tremulous.&nbsp; Inwardly she quaked,
because she dreaded and admired the calm, self-contained
character of her daughter Winnie, whose displeasure was made
redoubtable by a diversity of dreadful silences.&nbsp; But she
did not allow her inward apprehensions to rob her of the
advantage of venerable placidity conferred upon her outward
person by her triple chin, the floating ampleness of her ancient
form, and the impotent condition of her legs.</p>
<p>The shock of the information was so unexpected that Mrs
Verloc, against her usual practice when addressed, interrupted
the domestic occupation she was engaged upon.&nbsp; It was the
dusting of the furniture in the parlour behind the shop.&nbsp;
She turned her head towards her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever did you want to do that for?&rdquo; she
exclaimed, in scandalised astonishment.</p>
<p>The shock must have been severe to make her depart from that
distant and uninquiring acceptance of facts which was her force
and her safeguard in life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you made comfortable enough
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had lapsed into these inquiries, but next moment she saved
the consistency of her conduct by resuming her dusting, while the
old woman sat scared and dumb under her dingy white cap and
lustreless dark wig.</p>
<p>Winnie finished the chair, and ran the duster along the
mahogany at the back of the horse-hair sofa on which Mr Verloc
loved to take his ease in hat and overcoat.&nbsp; She was intent
on her work, but presently she permitted herself another
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world did you manage it, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As not affecting the inwardness of things, which it was Mrs
Verloc&rsquo;s principle to ignore, this curiosity was
excusable.&nbsp; It bore merely on the methods.&nbsp; The old
woman welcomed it eagerly as bringing forward something that
could be talked about with much sincerity.</p>
<p>She favoured her daughter by an exhaustive answer, full of
names and enriched by side comments upon the ravages of time as
observed in the alteration of human countenances.&nbsp; The names
were principally the names of licensed
victuallers&mdash;&ldquo;poor daddy&rsquo;s friends, my
dear.&rdquo;&nbsp; She enlarged with special appreciation on the
kindness and condescension of a large brewer, a Baronet and an M.
P., the Chairman of the Governors of the Charity.&nbsp; She
expressed herself thus warmly because she had been allowed to
interview by appointment his Private Secretary&mdash;&ldquo;a
very polite gentleman, all in black, with a gentle, sad voice,
but so very, very thin and quiet.&nbsp; He was like a shadow, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winnie, prolonging her dusting operations till the tale was
told to the end, walked out of the parlour into the kitchen (down
two steps) in her usual manner, without the slightest
comment.</p>
<p>Shedding a few tears in sign of rejoicing at her
daughter&rsquo;s mansuetude in this terrible affair, Mrs
Verloc&rsquo;s mother gave play to her astuteness in the
direction of her furniture, because it was her own; and sometimes
she wished it hadn&rsquo;t been.&nbsp; Heroism is all very well,
but there are circumstances when the disposal of a few tables and
chairs, brass bedsteads, and so on, may be big with remote and
disastrous consequences.&nbsp; She required a few pieces herself,
the Foundation which, after many importunities, had gathered her
to its charitable breast, giving nothing but bare planks and
cheaply papered bricks to the objects of its solicitude.&nbsp;
The delicacy guiding her choice to the least valuable and most
dilapidated articles passed unacknowledged, because
Winnie&rsquo;s philosophy consisted in not taking notice of the
inside of facts; she assumed that mother took what suited her
best.&nbsp; As to Mr Verloc, his intense meditation, like a sort
of Chinese wall, isolated him completely from the phenomena of
this world of vain effort and illusory appearances.</p>
<p>Her selection made, the disposal of the rest became a
perplexing question in a particular way.&nbsp; She was leaving it
in Brett Street, of course.&nbsp; But she had two children.&nbsp;
Winnie was provided for by her sensible union with that excellent
husband, Mr Verloc.&nbsp; Stevie was destitute&mdash;and a little
peculiar.&nbsp; His position had to be considered before the
claims of legal justice and even the promptings of
partiality.&nbsp; The possession of the furniture would not be in
any sense a provision.&nbsp; He ought to have it&mdash;the poor
boy.&nbsp; But to give it to him would be like tampering with his
position of complete dependence.&nbsp; It was a sort of claim
which she feared to weaken.&nbsp; Moreover, the susceptibilities
of Mr Verloc would perhaps not brook being beholden to his
brother-in-law for the chairs he sat on.&nbsp; In a long
experience of gentlemen lodgers, Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s mother had
acquired a dismal but resigned notion of the fantastic side of
human nature.&nbsp; What if Mr Verloc suddenly took it into his
head to tell Stevie to take his blessed sticks somewhere out of
that?&nbsp; A division, on the other hand, however carefully
made, might give some cause of offence to Winnie.&nbsp; No,
Stevie must remain destitute and dependent.&nbsp; And at the
moment of leaving Brett Street she had said to her daughter:
&ldquo;No use waiting till I am dead, is there?&nbsp; Everything
I leave here is altogether your own now, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winnie, with her hat on, silent behind her mother&rsquo;s
back, went on arranging the collar of the old woman&rsquo;s
cloak.&nbsp; She got her hand-bag, an umbrella, with an impassive
face.&nbsp; The time had come for the expenditure of the sum of
three-and-sixpence on what might well be supposed the last cab
drive of Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; They went
out at the shop door.</p>
<p>The conveyance awaiting them would have illustrated the
proverb that &ldquo;truth can be more cruel than
caricature,&rdquo; if such a proverb existed.&nbsp; Crawling
behind an infirm horse, a metropolitan hackney carriage drew up
on wobbly wheels and with a maimed driver on the box.&nbsp; This
last peculiarity caused some embarrassment.&nbsp; Catching sight
of a hooked iron contrivance protruding from the left sleeve of
the man&rsquo;s coat, Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s mother lost suddenly the
heroic courage of these days.&nbsp; She really couldn&rsquo;t
trust herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you think,
Winnie?&rdquo;&nbsp; She hung back.&nbsp; The passionate
expostulations of the big-faced cabman seemed to be squeezed out
of a blocked throat.&nbsp; Leaning over from his box, he
whispered with mysterious indignation.&nbsp; What was the matter
now?&nbsp; Was it possible to treat a man so?&nbsp; His enormous
and unwashed countenance flamed red in the muddy stretch of the
street.&nbsp; Was it likely they would have given him a licence,
he inquired desperately, if&mdash;</p>
<p>The police constable of the locality quieted him by a friendly
glance; then addressing himself to the two women without marked
consideration, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been driving a cab for twenty years.&nbsp; I
never knew him to have an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accident!&rdquo; shouted the driver in a scornful
whisper.</p>
<p>The policeman&rsquo;s testimony settled it.&nbsp; The modest
assemblage of seven people, mostly under age, dispersed.&nbsp;
Winnie followed her mother into the cab.&nbsp; Stevie climbed on
the box.&nbsp; His vacant mouth and distressed eyes depicted the
state of his mind in regard to the transactions which were taking
place.&nbsp; In the narrow streets the progress of the journey
was made sensible to those within by the near fronts of the
houses gliding past slowly and shakily, with a great rattle and
jingling of glass, as if about to collapse behind the cab; and
the infirm horse, with the harness hung over his sharp backbone
flapping very loose about his thighs, appeared to be dancing
mincingly on his toes with infinite patience.&nbsp; Later on, in
the wider space of Whitehall, all visual evidences of motion
became imperceptible.&nbsp; The rattle and jingle of glass went
on indefinitely in front of the long Treasury building&mdash;and
time itself seemed to stand still.</p>
<p>At last Winnie observed: &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a very good
horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes gleamed in the shadow of the cab straight ahead,
immovable.&nbsp; On the box, Stevie shut his vacant mouth first,
in order to ejaculate earnestly: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver, holding high the reins twisted around the hook,
took no notice.&nbsp; Perhaps he had not heard.&nbsp;
Stevie&rsquo;s breast heaved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t whip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man turned slowly his bloated and sodden face of many
colours bristling with white hairs.&nbsp; His little red eyes
glistened with moisture.&nbsp; His big lips had a violet
tint.&nbsp; They remained closed.&nbsp; With the dirty back of
his whip-hand he rubbed the stubble sprouting on his enormous
chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; stammered out Stevie
violently.&nbsp; &ldquo;It hurts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t whip,&rdquo; queried the other in a
thoughtful whisper, and immediately whipped.&nbsp; He did this,
not because his soul was cruel and his heart evil, but because he
had to earn his fare.&nbsp; And for a time the walls of St
Stephen&rsquo;s, with its towers and pinnacles, contemplated in
immobility and silence a cab that jingled.&nbsp; It rolled too,
however.&nbsp; But on the bridge there was a commotion.&nbsp;
Stevie suddenly proceeded to get down from the box.&nbsp; There
were shouts on the pavement, people ran forward, the driver
pulled up, whispering curses of indignation and
astonishment.&nbsp; Winnie lowered the window, and put her head
out, white as a ghost.&nbsp; In the depths of the cab, her mother
was exclaiming, in tones of anguish: &ldquo;Is that boy
hurt?&nbsp; Is that boy hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stevie was not hurt, he had not even fallen, but excitement as
usual had robbed him of the power of connected speech.&nbsp; He
could do no more than stammer at the window.&nbsp; &ldquo;Too
heavy.&nbsp; Too heavy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Winnie put out her hand on
to his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stevie!&nbsp; Get up on the box directly, and
don&rsquo;t try to get down again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Walk.&nbsp; Must walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In trying to state the nature of that necessity he stammered
himself into utter incoherence.&nbsp; No physical impossibility
stood in the way of his whim.&nbsp; Stevie could have managed
easily to keep pace with the infirm, dancing horse without
getting out of breath.&nbsp; But his sister withheld her consent
decisively.&nbsp; &ldquo;The idea!&nbsp; Whoever heard of such a
thing!&nbsp; Run after a cab!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her mother, frightened
and helpless in the depths of the conveyance, entreated:
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let him, Winnie.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll get
lost.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&nbsp; What next!&nbsp; Mr Verloc will be
sorry to hear of this nonsense, Stevie,&mdash;I can tell
you.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t be happy at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea of Mr Verloc&rsquo;s grief and unhappiness acting as
usual powerfully upon Stevie&rsquo;s fundamentally docile
disposition, he abandoned all resistance, and climbed up again on
the box, with a face of despair.</p>
<p>The cabby turned at him his enormous and inflamed countenance
truculently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go for trying this
silly game again, young fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After delivering himself thus in a stern whisper, strained
almost to extinction, he drove on, ruminating solemnly.&nbsp; To
his mind the incident remained somewhat obscure.&nbsp; But his
intellect, though it had lost its pristine vivacity in the
benumbing years of sedentary exposure to the weather, lacked not
independence or sanity.&nbsp; Gravely he dismissed the hypothesis
of Stevie being a drunken young nipper.</p>
<p>Inside the cab the spell of silence, in which the two women
had endured shoulder to shoulder the jolting, rattling, and
jingling of the journey, had been broken by Stevie&rsquo;s
outbreak.&nbsp; Winnie raised her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done what you wanted, mother.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll have only yourself to thank for it if you
aren&rsquo;t happy afterwards.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;ll be.&nbsp; That I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Weren&rsquo;t
you comfortable enough in the house?&nbsp; Whatever
people&rsquo;ll think of us&mdash;you throwing yourself like this
on a Charity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; screamed the old woman earnestly above
the noise, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been the best of daughters to
me.&nbsp; As to Mr Verloc&mdash;there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Words failing her on the subject of Mr Verloc&rsquo;s
excellence, she turned her old tearful eyes to the roof of the
cab.&nbsp; Then she averted her head on the pretence of looking
out of the window, as if to judge of their progress.&nbsp; It was
insignificant, and went on close to the curbstone.&nbsp; Night,
the early dirty night, the sinister, noisy, hopeless and rowdy
night of South London, had overtaken her on her last cab
drive.&nbsp; In the gas-light of the low-fronted shops her big
cheeks glowed with an orange hue under a black and mauve
bonnet.</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s complexion had become yellow
by the effect of age and from a natural predisposition to
biliousness, favoured by the trials of a difficult and worried
existence, first as wife, then as widow.&nbsp; It was a
complexion, that under the influence of a blush would take on an
orange tint.&nbsp; And this woman, modest indeed but hardened in
the fires of adversity, of an age, moreover, when blushes are not
expected, had positively blushed before her daughter.&nbsp; In
the privacy of a four-wheeler, on her way to a charity cottage
(one of a row) which by the exiguity of its dimensions and the
simplicity of its accommodation, might well have been devised in
kindness as a place of training for the still more straitened
circumstances of the grave, she was forced to hid from her own
child a blush of remorse and shame.</p>
<p>Whatever people will think?&nbsp; She knew very well what they
did think, the people Winnie had in her mind&mdash;the old
friends of her husband, and others too, whose interest she had
solicited with such flattering success.&nbsp; She had not known
before what a good beggar she could be.&nbsp; But she guessed
very well what inference was drawn from her application.&nbsp; On
account of that shrinking delicacy, which exists side by side
with aggressive brutality in masculine nature, the inquiries into
her circumstances had not been pushed very far.&nbsp; She had
checked them by a visible compression of the lips and some
display of an emotion determined to be eloquently silent.&nbsp;
And the men would become suddenly incurious, after the manner of
their kind.&nbsp; She congratulated herself more than once on
having nothing to do with women, who being naturally more callous
and avid of details, would have been anxious to be exactly
informed by what sort of unkind conduct her daughter and
son-in-law had driven her to that sad extremity.&nbsp; It was
only before the Secretary of the great brewer M. P. and Chairman
of the Charity, who, acting for his principal, felt bound to be
conscientiously inquisitive as to the real circumstances of the
applicant, that she had burst into tears outright and aloud, as a
cornered woman will weep.&nbsp; The thin and polite gentleman,
after contemplating her with an air of being &ldquo;struck all of
a heap,&rdquo; abandoned his position under the cover of soothing
remarks.&nbsp; She must not distress herself.&nbsp; The deed of
the Charity did not absolutely specify &ldquo;childless
widows.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, it did not by any means disqualify
her.&nbsp; But the discretion of the Committee must be an
informed discretion.&nbsp; One could understand very well her
unwillingness to be a burden, etc. etc.&nbsp; Thereupon, to his
profound disappointment, Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s mother wept some more
with an augmented vehemence.</p>
<p>The tears of that large female in a dark, dusty wig, and
ancient silk dress festooned with dingy white cotton lace, were
the tears of genuine distress.&nbsp; She had wept because she was
heroic and unscrupulous and full of love for both her
children.&nbsp; Girls frequently get sacrificed to the welfare of
the boys.&nbsp; In this case she was sacrificing Winnie.&nbsp; By
the suppression of truth she was slandering her.&nbsp; Of course,
Winnie was independent, and need not care for the opinion of
people that she would never see and who would never see her;
whereas poor Stevie had nothing in the world he could call his
own except his mother&rsquo;s heroism and unscrupulousness.</p>
<p>The first sense of security following on Winnie&rsquo;s
marriage wore off in time (for nothing lasts), and Mrs
Verloc&rsquo;s mother, in the seclusion of the back bedroom, had
recalled the teaching of that experience which the world
impresses upon a widowed woman.&nbsp; But she had recalled it
without vain bitterness; her store of resignation amounted almost
to dignity.&nbsp; She reflected stoically that everything decays,
wears out, in this world; that the way of kindness should be made
easy to the well disposed; that her daughter Winnie was a most
devoted sister, and a very self-confident wife indeed.&nbsp; As
regards Winnie&rsquo;s sisterly devotion, her stoicism
flinched.&nbsp; She excepted that sentiment from the rule of
decay affecting all things human and some things divine.&nbsp;
She could not help it; not to do so would have frightened her too
much.&nbsp; But in considering the conditions of her
daughter&rsquo;s married state, she rejected firmly all
flattering illusions.&nbsp; She took the cold and reasonable view
that the less strain put on Mr Verloc&rsquo;s kindness the longer
its effects were likely to last.&nbsp; That excellent man loved
his wife, of course, but he would, no doubt, prefer to keep as
few of her relations as was consistent with the proper display of
that sentiment.&nbsp; It would be better if its whole effect were
concentrated on poor Stevie.&nbsp; And the heroic old woman
resolved on going away from her children as an act of devotion
and as a move of deep policy.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; of this policy consisted in this (Mrs
Verloc&rsquo;s mother was subtle in her way), that Stevie&rsquo;s
moral claim would be strengthened.&nbsp; The poor boy&mdash;a
good, useful boy, if a little peculiar&mdash;had not a sufficient
standing.&nbsp; He had been taken over with his mother, somewhat
in the same way as the furniture of the Belgravian mansion had
been taken over, as if on the ground of belonging to her
exclusively.&nbsp; What will happen, she asked herself (for Mrs
Verloc&rsquo;s mother was in a measure imaginative), when I
die?&nbsp; And when she asked herself that question it was with
dread.&nbsp; It was also terrible to think that she would not
then have the means of knowing what happened to the poor
boy.&nbsp; But by making him over to his sister, by going thus
away, she gave him the advantage of a directly dependent
position.&nbsp; This was the more subtle sanction of Mrs
Verloc&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s heroism and unscrupulousness.&nbsp;
Her act of abandonment was really an arrangement for settling her
son permanently in life.&nbsp; Other people made material
sacrifices for such an object, she in that way.&nbsp; It was the
only way.&nbsp; Moreover, she would be able to see how it
worked.&nbsp; Ill or well she would avoid the horrible
incertitude on the death-bed.&nbsp; But it was hard, hard,
cruelly hard.</p>
<p>The cab rattled, jingled, jolted; in fact, the last was quite
extraordinary.&nbsp; By its disproportionate violence and
magnitude it obliterated every sensation of onward movement; and
the effect was of being shaken in a stationary apparatus like a
medi&aelig;val device for the punishment of crime, or some very
newfangled invention for the cure of a sluggish liver.&nbsp; It
was extremely distressing; and the raising of Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s
mother&rsquo;s voice sounded like a wail of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, my dear, you&rsquo;ll come to see me as often
as you can spare the time.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Winnie shortly, staring
straight before her.</p>
<p>And the cab jolted in front of a steamy, greasy shop in a
blaze of gas and in the smell of fried fish.</p>
<p>The old woman raised a wail again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, my dear, I must see that poor boy every
Sunday.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t mind spending the day with his old
mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winnie screamed out stolidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind!&nbsp; I should think not.&nbsp; That poor boy
will miss you something cruel.&nbsp; I wish you had thought a
little of that, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not think of it!&nbsp; The heroic woman swallowed a playful
and inconvenient object like a billiard ball, which had tried to
jump out of her throat.&nbsp; Winnie sat mute for a while,
pouting at the front of the cab, then snapped out, which was an
unusual tone with her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect I&rsquo;ll have a job with him at first,
he&rsquo;ll be that restless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t let him worry your
husband, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus they discussed on familiar lines the bearings of a new
situation.&nbsp; And the cab jolted.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s
mother expressed some misgivings.&nbsp; Could Stevie be trusted
to come all that way alone?&nbsp; Winnie maintained that he was
much less &ldquo;absent-minded&rdquo; now.&nbsp; They agreed as
to that.&nbsp; It could not be denied.&nbsp; Much
less&mdash;hardly at all.&nbsp; They shouted at each other in the
jingle with comparative cheerfulness.&nbsp; But suddenly the
maternal anxiety broke out afresh.&nbsp; There were two omnibuses
to take, and a short walk between.&nbsp; It was too
difficult!&nbsp; The old woman gave way to grief and
consternation.</p>
<p>Winnie stared forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you upset yourself like this, mother.&nbsp;
You must see him, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll try not to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She mopped her streaming eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t spare the time to come with him,
and if he should forget himself and lose his way and somebody
spoke to him sharply, his name and address may slip his memory,
and he&rsquo;ll remain lost for days and days&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vision of a workhouse infirmary for poor Stevie&mdash;if
only during inquiries&mdash;wrung her heart.&nbsp; For she was a
proud woman.&nbsp; Winnie&rsquo;s stare had grown hard, intent,
inventive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bring him to you myself every
week,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you worry,
mother.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see to it that he don&rsquo;t get lost
for long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They felt a peculiar bump; a vision of brick pillars lingered
before the rattling windows of the cab; a sudden cessation of
atrocious jolting and uproarious jingling dazed the two
women.&nbsp; What had happened?&nbsp; They sat motionless and
scared in the profound stillness, till the door came open, and a
rough, strained whispering was heard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A range of gabled little houses, each with one dim yellow
window, on the ground floor, surrounded the dark open space of a
grass plot planted with shrubs and railed off from the patchwork
of lights and shadows in the wide road, resounding with the dull
rumble of traffic.&nbsp; Before the door of one of these tiny
houses&mdash;one without a light in the little downstairs
window&mdash;the cab had come to a standstill.&nbsp; Mrs
Verloc&rsquo;s mother got out first, backwards, with a key in her
hand.&nbsp; Winnie lingered on the flagstone path to pay the
cabman.&nbsp; Stevie, after helping to carry inside a lot of
small parcels, came out and stood under the light of a gas-lamp
belonging to the Charity.&nbsp; The cabman looked at the pieces
of silver, which, appearing very minute in his big, grimy palm,
symbolised the insignificant results which reward the ambitious
courage and toil of a mankind whose day is short on this earth of
evil.</p>
<p>He had been paid decently&mdash;four one-shilling
pieces&mdash;and he contemplated them in perfect stillness, as if
they had been the surprising terms of a melancholy problem.&nbsp;
The slow transfer of that treasure to an inner pocket demanded
much laborious groping in the depths of decayed clothing.&nbsp;
His form was squat and without flexibility.&nbsp; Stevie,
slender, his shoulders a little up, and his hands thrust deep in
the side pockets of his warm overcoat, stood at the edge of the
path, pouting.</p>
<p>The cabman, pausing in his deliberate movements, seemed struck
by some misty recollection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere you are, young fellow,&rdquo; he
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know him
again&mdash;won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stevie was staring at the horse, whose hind quarters appeared
unduly elevated by the effect of emaciation.&nbsp; The little
stiff tail seemed to have been fitted in for a heartless joke;
and at the other end the thin, flat neck, like a plank covered
with old horse-hide, drooped to the ground under the weight of an
enormous bony head.&nbsp; The ears hung at different angles,
negligently; and the macabre figure of that mute dweller on the
earth steamed straight up from ribs and backbone in the muggy
stillness of the air.</p>
<p>The cabman struck lightly Stevie&rsquo;s breast with the iron
hook protruding from a ragged, greasy sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere, young feller.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ow&rsquo;d
<i>you</i> like to sit behind this &rsquo;oss up to two
o&rsquo;clock in the morning p&rsquo;raps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stevie looked vacantly into the fierce little eyes with
red-edged lids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t lame,&rdquo; pursued the other,
whispering with energy.&nbsp; &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t got no sore
places on &rsquo;im.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere he is.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ow
would <i>you</i> like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His strained, extinct voice invested his utterance with a
character of vehement secrecy.&nbsp; Stevie&rsquo;s vacant gaze
was changing slowly into dread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may well look!&nbsp; Till three and four
o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; Cold and &rsquo;ungry.&nbsp;
Looking for fares.&nbsp; Drunks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His jovial purple cheeks bristled with white hairs; and like
Virgil&rsquo;s Silenus, who, his face smeared with the juice of
berries, discoursed of Olympian Gods to the innocent shepherds of
Sicily, he talked to Stevie of domestic matters and the affairs
of men whose sufferings are great and immortality by no means
assured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a night cabby, I am,&rdquo; he whispered, with a
sort of boastful exasperation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
take out what they will blooming well give me at the yard.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got my missus and four kids at &rsquo;ome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monstrous nature of that declaration of paternity seemed
to strike the world dumb.&nbsp; A silence reigned during which
the flanks of the old horse, the steed of apocalyptic misery,
smoked upwards in the light of the charitable gas-lamp.</p>
<p>The cabman grunted, then added in his mysterious whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t an easy world.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Stevie&rsquo;s face had been twitching for some time, and at last
his feelings burst out in their usual concise form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad!&nbsp; Bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His gaze remained fixed on the ribs of the horse,
self-conscious and sombre, as though he were afraid to look about
him at the badness of the world.&nbsp; And his slenderness, his
rosy lips and pale, clear complexion, gave him the aspect of a
delicate boy, notwithstanding the fluffy growth of golden hair on
his cheeks.&nbsp; He pouted in a scared way like a child.&nbsp;
The cabman, short and broad, eyed him with his fierce little eyes
that seemed to smart in a clear and corroding liquid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ard on &rsquo;osses, but dam&rsquo; sight
&rsquo;arder on poor chaps like me,&rdquo; he wheezed just
audibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor!&nbsp; Poor!&rdquo; stammered out Stevie, pushing
his hands deeper into his pockets with convulsive sympathy.&nbsp;
He could say nothing; for the tenderness to all pain and all
misery, the desire to make the horse happy and the cabman happy,
had reached the point of a bizarre longing to take them to bed
with him.&nbsp; And that, he knew, was impossible.&nbsp; For
Stevie was not mad.&nbsp; It was, as it were, a symbolic longing;
and at the same time it was very distinct, because springing from
experience, the mother of wisdom.&nbsp; Thus when as a child he
cowered in a dark corner scared, wretched, sore, and miserable
with the black, black misery of the soul, his sister Winnie used
to come along, and carry him off to bed with her, as into a
heaven of consoling peace.&nbsp; Stevie, though apt to forget
mere facts, such as his name and address for instance, had a
faithful memory of sensations.&nbsp; To be taken into a bed of
compassion was the supreme remedy, with the only one disadvantage
of being difficult of application on a large scale.&nbsp; And
looking at the cabman, Stevie perceived this clearly, because he
was reasonable.</p>
<p>The cabman went on with his leisurely preparations as if
Stevie had not existed.&nbsp; He made as if to hoist himself on
the box, but at the last moment from some obscure motive, perhaps
merely from disgust with carriage exercise, desisted.&nbsp; He
approached instead the motionless partner of his labours, and
stooping to seize the bridle, lifted up the big, weary head to
the height of his shoulder with one effort of his right arm, like
a feat of strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he whispered secretly.</p>
<p>Limping, he led the cab away.&nbsp; There was an air of
austerity in this departure, the scrunched gravel of the drive
crying out under the slowly turning wheels, the horse&rsquo;s
lean thighs moving with ascetic deliberation away from the light
into the obscurity of the open space bordered dimly by the
pointed roofs and the feebly shining windows of the little
alms-houses.&nbsp; The plaint of the gravel travelled slowly all
round the drive.&nbsp; Between the lamps of the charitable
gateway the slow cortege reappeared, lighted up for a moment, the
short, thick man limping busily, with the horse&rsquo;s head held
aloft in his fist, the lank animal walking in stiff and forlorn
dignity, the dark, low box on wheels rolling behind comically
with an air of waddling.&nbsp; They turned to the left.&nbsp;
There was a pub down the street, within fifty yards of the
gate.</p>
<p>Stevie left alone beside the private lamp-post of the Charity,
his hands thrust deep into his pockets, glared with vacant
sulkiness.&nbsp; At the bottom of his pockets his incapable weak
hands were clinched hard into a pair of angry fists.&nbsp; In the
face of anything which affected directly or indirectly his morbid
dread of pain, Stevie ended by turning vicious.&nbsp; A
magnanimous indignation swelled his frail chest to bursting, and
caused his candid eyes to squint.&nbsp; Supremely wise in knowing
his own powerlessness, Stevie was not wise enough to restrain his
passions.&nbsp; The tenderness of his universal charity had two
phases as indissolubly joined and connected as the reverse and
obverse sides of a medal.&nbsp; The anguish of immoderate
compassion was succeeded by the pain of an innocent but pitiless
rage.&nbsp; Those two states expressing themselves outwardly by
the same signs of futile bodily agitation, his sister Winnie
soothed his excitement without ever fathoming its twofold
character.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc wasted no portion of this transient
life in seeking for fundamental information.&nbsp; This is a sort
of economy having all the appearances and some of the advantages
of prudence.&nbsp; Obviously it may be good for one not to know
too much.&nbsp; And such a view accords very well with
constitutional indolence.</p>
<p>On that evening on which it may be said that Mrs
Verloc&rsquo;s mother having parted for good from her children
had also departed this life, Winnie Verloc did not investigate
her brother&rsquo;s psychology.&nbsp; The poor boy was excited,
of course.&nbsp; After once more assuring the old woman on the
threshold that she would know how to guard against the risk of
Stevie losing himself for very long on his pilgrimages of filial
piety, she took her brother&rsquo;s arm to walk away.&nbsp;
Stevie did not even mutter to himself, but with the special sense
of sisterly devotion developed in her earliest infancy, she felt
that the boy was very much excited indeed.&nbsp; Holding tight to
his arm, under the appearance of leaning on it, she thought of
some words suitable to the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Stevie, you must look well after me at the
crossings, and get first into the &rsquo;bus, like a good
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This appeal to manly protection was received by Stevie with
his usual docility.&nbsp; It flattered him.&nbsp; He raised his
head and threw out his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be nervous, Winnie.&nbsp; Mustn&rsquo;t be
nervous!&nbsp; &rsquo;Bus all right,&rdquo; he answered in a
brusque, slurring stammer partaking of the timorousness of a
child and the resolution of a man.&nbsp; He advanced fearlessly
with the woman on his arm, but his lower lip dropped.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, on the pavement of the squalid and wide
thoroughfare, whose poverty in all the amenities of life stood
foolishly exposed by a mad profusion of gas-lights, their
resemblance to each other was so pronounced as to strike the
casual passers-by.</p>
<p>Before the doors of the public-house at the corner, where the
profusion of gas-light reached the height of positive wickedness,
a four-wheeled cab standing by the curbstone with no one on the
box, seemed cast out into the gutter on account of irremediable
decay.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc recognised the conveyance.&nbsp; Its
aspect was so profoundly lamentable, with such a perfection of
grotesque misery and weirdness of macabre detail, as if it were
the Cab of Death itself, that Mrs Verloc, with that ready
compassion of a woman for a horse (when she is not sitting behind
him), exclaimed vaguely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor brute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hanging back suddenly, Stevie inflicted an arresting jerk upon
his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor!&nbsp; Poor!&rdquo; he ejaculated
appreciatively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cabman poor too.&nbsp; He told me
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contemplation of the infirm and lonely steed overcame
him.&nbsp; Jostled, but obstinate, he would remain there, trying
to express the view newly opened to his sympathies of the human
and equine misery in close association.&nbsp; But it was very
difficult.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor brute, poor people!&rdquo; was all
he could repeat.&nbsp; It did not seem forcible enough, and he
came to a stop with an angry splutter: &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Stevie was no master of phrases, and perhaps for that very reason
his thoughts lacked clearness and precision.&nbsp; But he felt
with greater completeness and some profundity.&nbsp; That little
word contained all his sense of indignation and horror at one
sort of wretchedness having to feed upon the anguish of the
other&mdash;at the poor cabman beating the poor horse in the
name, as it were, of his poor kids at home.&nbsp; And Stevie knew
what it was to be beaten.&nbsp; He knew it from experience.&nbsp;
It was a bad world.&nbsp; Bad!&nbsp; Bad!</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc, his only sister, guardian, and protector, could
not pretend to such depths of insight.&nbsp; Moreover, she had
not experienced the magic of the cabman&rsquo;s eloquence.&nbsp;
She was in the dark as to the inwardness of the word
&ldquo;Shame.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she said placidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Stevie.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t help
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The docile Stevie went along; but now he went along without
pride, shamblingly, and muttering half words, and even words that
would have been whole if they had not been made up of halves that
did not belong to each other.&nbsp; It was as though he had been
trying to fit all the words he could remember to his sentiments
in order to get some sort of corresponding idea.&nbsp; And, as a
matter of fact, he got it at last.&nbsp; He hung back to utter it
at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad world for poor people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Directly he had expressed that thought he became aware that it
was familiar to him already in all its consequences.&nbsp; This
circumstance strengthened his conviction immensely, but also
augmented his indignation.&nbsp; Somebody, he felt, ought to be
punished for it&mdash;punished with great severity.&nbsp; Being
no sceptic, but a moral creature, he was in a manner at the mercy
of his righteous passions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beastly!&rdquo; he added concisely.</p>
<p>It was clear to Mrs Verloc that he was greatly excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody can help that,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
come along.&nbsp; Is that the way you&rsquo;re taking care of
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stevie mended his pace obediently.&nbsp; He prided himself on
being a good brother.&nbsp; His morality, which was very
complete, demanded that from him.&nbsp; Yet he was pained at the
information imparted by his sister Winnie who was good.&nbsp;
Nobody could help that!&nbsp; He came along gloomily, but
presently he brightened up.&nbsp; Like the rest of mankind,
perplexed by the mystery of the universe, he had his moments of
consoling trust in the organised powers of the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police,&rdquo; he suggested confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police aren&rsquo;t for that,&rdquo; observed Mrs
Verloc cursorily, hurrying on her way.</p>
<p>Stevie&rsquo;s face lengthened considerably.&nbsp; He was
thinking.&nbsp; The more intense his thinking, the slacker was
the droop of his lower jaw.</p>
<p>And it was with an aspect of hopeless vacancy that he gave up
his intellectual enterprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for that?&rdquo; he mumbled, resigned but
surprised.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not for that?&rdquo;&nbsp; He had formed
for himself an ideal conception of the metropolitan police as a
sort of benevolent institution for the suppression of evil.&nbsp;
The notion of benevolence especially was very closely associated
with his sense of the power of the men in blue.&nbsp; He had
liked all police constables tenderly, with a guileless
trustfulness.&nbsp; And he was pained.&nbsp; He was irritated,
too, by a suspicion of duplicity in the members of the
force.&nbsp; For Stevie was frank and as open as the day
himself.&nbsp; What did they mean by pretending then?&nbsp;
Unlike his sister, who put her trust in face values, he wished to
go to the bottom of the matter.&nbsp; He carried on his inquiry
by means of an angry challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for are they then, Winn?&nbsp; What are they
for?&nbsp; Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winnie disliked controversy.&nbsp; But fearing most a fit of
black depression consequent on Stevie missing his mother very
much at first, she did not altogether decline the
discussion.&nbsp; Guiltless of all irony, she answered yet in a
form which was not perhaps unnatural in the wife of Mr Verloc,
Delegate of the Central Red Committee, personal friend of certain
anarchists, and a votary of social revolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what the police are for,
Stevie?&nbsp; They are there so that them as have nothing
shouldn&rsquo;t take anything away from them who have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She avoided using the verb &ldquo;to steal,&rdquo; because it
always made her brother uncomfortable.&nbsp; For Stevie was
delicately honest.&nbsp; Certain simple principles had been
instilled into him so anxiously (on account of his
&ldquo;queerness&rdquo;) that the mere names of certain
transgressions filled him with horror.&nbsp; He had been always
easily impressed by speeches.&nbsp; He was impressed and startled
now, and his intelligence was very alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asked at once anxiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not even if they were hungry?&nbsp; Mustn&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two had paused in their walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if they were ever so,&rdquo; said Mrs Verloc, with
the equanimity of a person untroubled by the problem of the
distribution of wealth, and exploring the perspective of the
roadway for an omnibus of the right colour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly not.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s the use of talking
about all that?&nbsp; You aren&rsquo;t ever hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She cast a swift glance at the boy, like a young man, by her
side.&nbsp; She saw him amiable, attractive, affectionate, and
only a little, a very little, peculiar.&nbsp; And she could not
see him otherwise, for he was connected with what there was of
the salt of passion in her tasteless life&mdash;the passion of
indignation, of courage, of pity, and even of
self-sacrifice.&nbsp; She did not add: &ldquo;And you
aren&rsquo;t likely ever to be as long as I live.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But she might very well have done so, since she had taken
effectual steps to that end.&nbsp; Mr Verloc was a very good
husband.&nbsp; It was her honest impression that nobody could
help liking the boy.&nbsp; She cried out suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Stevie.&nbsp; Stop that green
&rsquo;bus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Stevie, tremulous and important with his sister Winnie on
his arm, flung up the other high above his head at the
approaching &rsquo;bus, with complete success.</p>
<p>An hour afterwards Mr Verloc raised his eyes from a newspaper
he was reading, or at any rate looking at, behind the counter,
and in the expiring clatter of the door-bell beheld Winnie, his
wife, enter and cross the shop on her way upstairs, followed by
Stevie, his brother-in-law.&nbsp; The sight of his wife was
agreeable to Mr Verloc.&nbsp; It was his idiosyncrasy.&nbsp; The
figure of his brother-in-law remained imperceptible to him
because of the morose thoughtfulness that lately had fallen like
a veil between Mr Verloc and the appearances of the world of
senses.&nbsp; He looked after his wife fixedly, without a word,
as though she had been a phantom.&nbsp; His voice for home use
was husky and placid, but now it was heard not at all.&nbsp; It
was not heard at supper, to which he was called by his wife in
the usual brief manner: &ldquo;Adolf.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sat down to
consume it without conviction, wearing his hat pushed far back on
his head.&nbsp; It was not devotion to an outdoor life, but the
frequentation of foreign caf&eacute;s which was responsible for
that habit, investing with a character of unceremonious
impermanency Mr Verloc&rsquo;s steady fidelity to his own
fireside.&nbsp; Twice at the clatter of the cracked bell he arose
without a word, disappeared into the shop, and came back
silently.&nbsp; During these absences Mrs Verloc, becoming
acutely aware of the vacant place at her right hand, missed her
mother very much, and stared stonily; while Stevie, from the same
reason, kept on shuffling his feet, as though the floor under the
table were uncomfortably hot.&nbsp; When Mr Verloc returned to
sit in his place, like the very embodiment of silence, the
character of Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s stare underwent a subtle change,
and Stevie ceased to fidget with his feet, because of his great
and awed regard for his sister&rsquo;s husband.&nbsp; He directed
at him glances of respectful compassion.&nbsp; Mr Verloc was
sorry.&nbsp; His sister Winnie had impressed upon him (in the
omnibus) that Mr Verloc would be found at home in a state of
sorrow, and must not be worried.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s anger,
the irritability of gentlemen lodgers, and Mr Verloc&rsquo;s
predisposition to immoderate grief, had been the main sanctions
of Stevie&rsquo;s self-restraint.&nbsp; Of these sentiments, all
easily provoked, but not always easy to understand, the last had
the greatest moral efficiency&mdash;because Mr Verloc was
<i>good</i>.&nbsp; His mother and his sister had established that
ethical fact on an unshakable foundation.&nbsp; They had
established, erected, consecrated it behind Mr Verloc&rsquo;s
back, for reasons that had nothing to do with abstract
morality.&nbsp; And Mr Verloc was not aware of it.&nbsp; It is
but bare justice to him to say that he had no notion of appearing
good to Stevie.&nbsp; Yet so it was.&nbsp; He was even the only
man so qualified in Stevie&rsquo;s knowledge, because the
gentlemen lodgers had been too transient and too remote to have
anything very distinct about them but perhaps their boots; and as
regards the disciplinary measures of his father, the desolation
of his mother and sister shrank from setting up a theory of
goodness before the victim.&nbsp; It would have been too
cruel.&nbsp; And it was even possible that Stevie would not have
believed them.&nbsp; As far as Mr Verloc was concerned, nothing
could stand in the way of Stevie&rsquo;s belief.&nbsp; Mr Verloc
was obviously yet mysteriously <i>good</i>.&nbsp; And the grief
of a good man is august.</p>
<p>Stevie gave glances of reverential compassion to his
brother-in-law.&nbsp; Mr Verloc was sorry.&nbsp; The brother of
Winnie had never before felt himself in such close communion with
the mystery of that man&rsquo;s goodness.&nbsp; It was an
understandable sorrow.&nbsp; And Stevie himself was sorry.&nbsp;
He was very sorry.&nbsp; The same sort of sorrow.&nbsp; And his
attention being drawn to this unpleasant state, Stevie shuffled
his feet.&nbsp; His feelings were habitually manifested by the
agitation of his limbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your feet quiet, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs Verloc,
with authority and tenderness; then turning towards her husband
in an indifferent voice, the masterly achievement of instinctive
tact: &ldquo;Are you going out to-night?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The mere suggestion seemed repugnant to Mr Verloc.&nbsp; He
shook his head moodily, and then sat still with downcast eyes,
looking at the piece of cheese on his plate for a whole
minute.&nbsp; At the end of that time he got up, and went
out&mdash;went right out in the clatter of the shop-door
bell.&nbsp; He acted thus inconsistently, not from any desire to
make himself unpleasant, but because of an unconquerable
restlessness.&nbsp; It was no earthly good going out.&nbsp; He
could not find anywhere in London what he wanted.&nbsp; But he
went out.&nbsp; He led a cortege of dismal thoughts along dark
streets, through lighted streets, in and out of two flash bars,
as if in a half-hearted attempt to make a night of it, and
finally back again to his menaced home, where he sat down
fatigued behind the counter, and they crowded urgently round him,
like a pack of hungry black hounds.&nbsp; After locking up the
house and putting out the gas he took them upstairs with
him&mdash;a dreadful escort for a man going to bed.&nbsp; His
wife had preceded him some time before, and with her ample form
defined vaguely under the counterpane, her head on the pillow,
and a hand under the cheek offered to his distraction the view of
early drowsiness arguing the possession of an equable soul.&nbsp;
Her big eyes stared wide open, inert and dark against the snowy
whiteness of the linen.&nbsp; She did not move.</p>
<p>She had an equable soul.&nbsp; She felt profoundly that things
do not stand much looking into.&nbsp; She made her force and her
wisdom of that instinct.&nbsp; But the taciturnity of Mr Verloc
had been lying heavily upon her for a good many days.&nbsp; It
was, as a matter of fact, affecting her nerves.&nbsp; Recumbent
and motionless, she said placidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch cold walking about in your socks
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech, becoming the solicitude of the wife and the
prudence of the woman, took Mr Verloc unawares.&nbsp; He had left
his boots downstairs, but he had forgotten to put on his
slippers, and he had been turning about the bedroom on noiseless
pads like a bear in a cage.&nbsp; At the sound of his
wife&rsquo;s voice he stopped and stared at her with a
somnambulistic, expressionless gaze so long that Mrs Verloc moved
her limbs slightly under the bed-clothes.&nbsp; But she did not
move her black head sunk in the white pillow one hand under her
cheek and the big, dark, unwinking eyes.</p>
<p>Under her husband&rsquo;s expressionless stare, and
remembering her mother&rsquo;s empty room across the landing, she
felt an acute pang of loneliness.&nbsp; She had never been parted
from her mother before.&nbsp; They had stood by each other.&nbsp;
She felt that they had, and she said to herself that now mother
was gone&mdash;gone for good.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc had no
illusions.&nbsp; Stevie remained, however.&nbsp; And she
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s done what she wanted to do.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no sense in it that I can see.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
she couldn&rsquo;t have thought you had enough of her.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s perfectly wicked, leaving us like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc was not a well-read person; his range of allusive
phrases was limited, but there was a peculiar aptness in
circumstances which made him think of rats leaving a doomed
ship.&nbsp; He very nearly said so.&nbsp; He had grown suspicious
and embittered.&nbsp; Could it be that the old woman had such an
excellent nose?&nbsp; But the unreasonableness of such a
suspicion was patent, and Mr Verloc held his tongue.&nbsp; Not
altogether, however.&nbsp; He muttered heavily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s just as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to undress.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc kept very still,
perfectly still, with her eyes fixed in a dreamy, quiet
stare.&nbsp; And her heart for the fraction of a second seemed to
stand still too.&nbsp; That night she was &ldquo;not quite
herself,&rdquo; as the saying is, and it was borne upon her with
some force that a simple sentence may hold several diverse
meanings&mdash;mostly disagreeable.&nbsp; How was it just as
well?&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; But she did not allow herself to fall
into the idleness of barren speculation.&nbsp; She was rather
confirmed in her belief that things did not stand being looked
into.&nbsp; Practical and subtle in her way, she brought Stevie
to the front without loss of time, because in her the singleness
of purpose had the unerring nature and the force of an
instinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I am going to do to cheer up that boy for the
first few days I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll be worrying himself from morning till night before he
gets used to mother being away.&nbsp; And he&rsquo;s such a good
boy.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t do without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc went on divesting himself of his clothing with the
unnoticing inward concentration of a man undressing in the
solitude of a vast and hopeless desert.&nbsp; For thus
inhospitably did this fair earth, our common inheritance, present
itself to the mental vision of Mr Verloc.&nbsp; All was so still
without and within that the lonely ticking of the clock on the
landing stole into the room as if for the sake of company.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc, getting into bed on his own side, remained prone
and mute behind Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; His thick arms
rested abandoned on the outside of the counterpane like dropped
weapons, like discarded tools.&nbsp; At that moment he was within
a hair&rsquo;s breadth of making a clean breast of it all to his
wife.&nbsp; The moment seemed propitious.&nbsp; Looking out of
the corners of his eyes, he saw her ample shoulders draped in
white, the back of her head, with the hair done for the night in
three plaits tied up with black tapes at the ends.&nbsp; And he
forbore.&nbsp; Mr Verloc loved his wife as a wife should be
loved&mdash;that is, maritally, with the regard one has for
one&rsquo;s chief possession.&nbsp; This head arranged for the
night, those ample shoulders, had an aspect of familiar
sacredness&mdash;the sacredness of domestic peace.&nbsp; She
moved not, massive and shapeless like a recumbent statue in the
rough; he remembered her wide-open eyes looking into the empty
room.&nbsp; She was mysterious, with the mysteriousness of living
beings.&nbsp; The far-famed secret agent [delta] of the late
Baron Stott-Wartenheim&rsquo;s alarmist despatches was not the
man to break into such mysteries.&nbsp; He was easily
intimidated.&nbsp; And he was also indolent, with the indolence
which is so often the secret of good nature.&nbsp; He forbore
touching that mystery out of love, timidity, and indolence.&nbsp;
There would be always time enough.&nbsp; For several minutes he
bore his sufferings silently in the drowsy silence of the
room.&nbsp; And then he disturbed it by a resolute
declaration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going on the Continent to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife might have fallen asleep already.&nbsp; He could not
tell.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, Mrs Verloc had heard him.&nbsp;
Her eyes remained very wide open, and she lay very still,
confirmed in her instinctive conviction that things don&rsquo;t
bear looking into very much.&nbsp; And yet it was nothing very
unusual for Mr Verloc to take such a trip.&nbsp; He renewed his
stock from Paris and Brussels.&nbsp; Often he went over to make
his purchases personally.&nbsp; A little select connection of
amateurs was forming around the shop in Brett Street, a secret
connection eminently proper for any business undertaken by Mr
Verloc, who, by a mystic accord of temperament and necessity, had
been set apart to be a secret agent all his life.</p>
<p>He waited for a while, then added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be away a
week or perhaps a fortnight.&nbsp; Get Mrs Neale to come for the
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Neale was the charwoman of Brett Street.&nbsp; Victim of
her marriage with a debauched joiner, she was oppressed by the
needs of many infant children.&nbsp; Red-armed, and aproned in
coarse sacking up to the arm-pits, she exhaled the anguish of the
poor in a breath of soap-suds and rum, in the uproar of
scrubbing, in the clatter of tin pails.</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc, full of deep purpose, spoke in the tone of the
shallowest indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need to have the woman here all day.&nbsp;
I shall do very well with Stevie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She let the lonely clock on the landing count off fifteen
ticks into the abyss of eternity, and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I put the light out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc snapped at his wife huskily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it out.&rdquo;</p>
