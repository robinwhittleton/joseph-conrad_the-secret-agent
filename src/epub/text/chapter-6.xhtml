<p>The lady patroness of Michaelis, the ticket-of-leave apostle
of humanitarian hopes, was one of the most influential and
distinguished connections of the Assistant Commissioner&rsquo;s
wife, whom she called Annie, and treated still rather as a not
very wise and utterly inexperienced young girl.&nbsp; But she had
consented to accept him on a friendly footing, which was by no
means the case with all of his wife&rsquo;s influential
connections.&nbsp; Married young and splendidly at some remote
epoch of the past, she had had for a time a close view of great
affairs and even of some great men.&nbsp; She herself was a great
lady.&nbsp; Old now in the number of her years, she had that sort
of exceptional temperament which defies time with scornful
disregard, as if it were a rather vulgar convention submitted to
by the mass of inferior mankind.&nbsp; Many other conventions
easier to set aside, alas! failed to obtain her recognition, also
on temperamental grounds&mdash;either because they bored her, or
else because they stood in the way of her scorns and
sympathies.&nbsp; Admiration was a sentiment unknown to her (it
was one of the secret griefs of her most noble husband against
her)&mdash;first, as always more or less tainted with mediocrity,
and next as being in a way an admission of inferiority.&nbsp; And
both were frankly inconceivable to her nature.&nbsp; To be
fearlessly outspoken in her opinions came easily to her, since
she judged solely from the standpoint of her social
position.&nbsp; She was equally untrammelled in her actions; and
as her tactfulness proceeded from genuine humanity, her bodily
vigour remained remarkable and her superiority was serene and
cordial, three generations had admired her infinitely, and the
last she was likely to see had pronounced her a wonderful
woman.&nbsp; Meantime intelligent, with a sort of lofty
simplicity, and curious at heart, but not like many women merely
of social gossip, she amused her age by attracting within her ken
through the power of her great, almost historical, social
prestige everything that rose above the dead level of mankind,
lawfully or unlawfully, by position, wit, audacity, fortune or
misfortune.&nbsp; Royal Highnesses, artists, men of science,
young statesmen, and charlatans of all ages and conditions, who,
unsubstantial and light, bobbing up like corks, show best the
direction of the surface currents, had been welcomed in that
house, listened to, penetrated, understood, appraised, for her
own edification.&nbsp; In her own words, she liked to watch what
the world was coming to.&nbsp; And as she had a practical mind
her judgment of men and things, though based on special
prejudices, was seldom totally wrong, and almost never
wrong-headed.&nbsp; Her drawing-room was probably the only place
in the wide world where an Assistant Commissioner of Police could
meet a convict liberated on a ticket-of-leave on other than
professional and official ground.&nbsp; Who had brought Michaelis
there one afternoon the Assistant Commissioner did not remember
very well.&nbsp; He had a notion it must have been a certain
Member of Parliament of illustrious parentage and unconventional
sympathies, which were the standing joke of the comic
papers.&nbsp; The notabilities and even the simple notorieties of
the day brought each other freely to that temple of an old
woman&rsquo;s not ignoble curiosity.&nbsp; You never could guess
whom you were likely to come upon being received in semi-privacy
within the faded blue silk and gilt frame screen, making a cosy
nook for a couch and a few arm-chairs in the great drawing-room,
with its hum of voices and the groups of people seated or
standing in the light of six tall windows.</p>
<p>Michaelis had been the object of a revulsion of popular
sentiment, the same sentiment which years ago had applauded the
ferocity of the life sentence passed upon him for complicity in a
rather mad attempt to rescue some prisoners from a police
van.&nbsp; The plan of the conspirators had been to shoot down
the horses and overpower the escort.&nbsp; Unfortunately, one of
the police constables got shot too.&nbsp; He left a wife and
three small children, and the death of that man aroused through
the length and breadth of a realm for whose defence, welfare, and
glory men die every day as matter of duty, an outburst of furious
indignation, of a raging implacable pity for the victim.&nbsp;
Three ring-leaders got hanged.&nbsp; Michaelis, young and slim,
locksmith by trade, and great frequenter of evening schools, did
not even know that anybody had been killed, his part with a few
others being to force open the door at the back of the special
conveyance.&nbsp; When arrested he had a bunch of skeleton keys
in one pocket, a heavy chisel in another, and a short crowbar in
his hand: neither more nor less than a burglar.&nbsp; But no
burglar would have received such a heavy sentence.&nbsp; The
death of the constable had made him miserable at heart, but the
failure of the plot also.&nbsp; He did not conceal either of
these sentiments from his empanelled countrymen, and that sort of
compunction appeared shockingly imperfect to the crammed
court.&nbsp; The judge on passing sentence commented feelingly
upon the depravity and callousness of the young prisoner.</p>
<p>That made the groundless fame of his condemnation; the fame of
his release was made for him on no better grounds by people who
wished to exploit the sentimental aspect of his imprisonment
either for purposes of their own or for no intelligible
purpose.&nbsp; He let them do so in the innocence of his heart
and the simplicity of his mind.&nbsp; Nothing that happened to
him individually had any importance.&nbsp; He was like those
saintly men whose personality is lost in the contemplation of
their faith.&nbsp; His ideas were not in the nature of
convictions.&nbsp; They were inaccessible to reasoning.&nbsp;
They formed in all their contradictions and obscurities an
invincible and humanitarian creed, which he confessed rather than
preached, with an obstinate gentleness, a smile of pacific
assurance on his lips, and his candid blue eyes cast down because
the sight of faces troubled his inspiration developed in
solitude.&nbsp; In that characteristic attitude, pathetic in his
grotesque and incurable obesity which he had to drag like a
galley slave&rsquo;s bullet to the end of his days, the Assistant
Commissioner of Police beheld the ticket-of-leave apostle filling
a privileged arm-chair within the screen.&nbsp; He sat there by
the head of the old lady&rsquo;s couch, mild-voiced and quiet,
with no more self-consciousness than a very small child, and with
something of a child&rsquo;s charm&mdash;the appealing charm of
trustfulness.&nbsp; Confident of the future, whose secret ways
had been revealed to him within the four walls of a well-known
penitentiary, he had no reason to look with suspicion upon
anybody.&nbsp; If he could not give the great and curious lady a
very definite idea as to what the world was coming to, he had
managed without effort to impress her by his unembittered faith,
by the sterling quality of his optimism.</p>
<p>A certain simplicity of thought is common to serene souls at
both ends of the social scale.&nbsp; The great lady was simple in
her own way.&nbsp; His views and beliefs had nothing in them to
shock or startle her, since she judged them from the standpoint
of her lofty position.&nbsp; Indeed, her sympathies were easily
accessible to a man of that sort.&nbsp; She was not an exploiting
capitalist herself; she was, as it were, above the play of
economic conditions.&nbsp; And she had a great capacity of pity
for the more obvious forms of common human miseries, precisely
because she was such a complete stranger to them that she had to
translate her conception into terms of mental suffering before
she could grasp the notion of their cruelty.&nbsp; The Assistant
Commissioner remembered very well the conversation between these
two.&nbsp; He had listened in silence.&nbsp; It was something as
exciting in a way, and even touching in its foredoomed futility,
as the efforts at moral intercourse between the inhabitants of
remote planets.&nbsp; But this grotesque incarnation of
humanitarian passion appealed somehow, to one&rsquo;s
imagination.&nbsp; At last Michaelis rose, and taking the great
lady&rsquo;s extended hand, shook it, retained it for a moment in
his great cushioned palm with unembarrassed friendliness, and
turned upon the semi-private nook of the drawing-room his back,
vast and square, and as if distended under the short tweed
jacket.&nbsp; Glancing about in serene benevolence, he waddled
along to the distant door between the knots of other
visitors.&nbsp; The murmur of conversations paused on his
passage.&nbsp; He smiled innocently at a tall, brilliant girl,
whose eyes met his accidentally, and went out unconscious of the
glances following him across the room.&nbsp; Michaelis&rsquo;
first appearance in the world was a success&mdash;a success of
esteem unmarred by a single murmur of derision.&nbsp; The
interrupted conversations were resumed in their proper tone,
grave or light.&nbsp; Only a well-set-up, long-limbed,
active-looking man of forty talking with two ladies near a window
remarked aloud, with an unexpected depth of feeling:
&ldquo;Eighteen stone, I should say, and not five foot six.&nbsp;
Poor fellow!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s terrible&mdash;terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady of the house, gazing absently at the Assistant
Commissioner, left alone with her on the private side of the
screen, seemed to be rearranging her mental impressions behind
her thoughtful immobility of a handsome old face.&nbsp; Men with
grey moustaches and full, healthy, vaguely smiling countenances
approached, circling round the screen; two mature women with a
matronly air of gracious resolution; a clean-shaved individual
with sunken cheeks, and dangling a gold-mounted eyeglass on a
broad black ribbon with an old-world, dandified effect.&nbsp; A
silence deferential, but full of reserves, reigned for a moment,
and then the great lady exclaimed, not with resentment, but with
a sort of protesting indignation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that officially is supposed to be a
revolutionist!&nbsp; What nonsense.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked hard
at the Assistant Commissioner, who murmured apologetically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a dangerous one perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not dangerous&mdash;I should think not indeed.&nbsp; He
is a mere believer.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the temperament of a
saint,&rdquo; declared the great lady in a firm tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And they kept him shut up for twenty years.&nbsp; One
shudders at the stupidity of it.&nbsp; And now they have let him
out everybody belonging to him is gone away somewhere or
dead.&nbsp; His parents are dead; the girl he was to marry has
died while he was in prison; he has lost the skill necessary for
his manual occupation.&nbsp; He told me all this himself with the
sweetest patience; but then, he said, he had had plenty of time
to think out things for himself.&nbsp; A pretty
compensation!&nbsp; If that&rsquo;s the stuff revolutionists are
made of some of us may well go on their knees to them,&rdquo; she
continued in a slightly bantering voice, while the banal society
smiles hardened on the worldly faces turned towards her with
conventional deference.&nbsp; &ldquo;The poor creature is
obviously no longer in a position to take care of himself.&nbsp;
Somebody will have to look after him a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should be recommended to follow a treatment of some
sort,&rdquo; the soldierly voice of the active-looking man was
heard advising earnestly from a distance.&nbsp; He was in the
pink of condition for his age, and even the texture of his long
frock coat had a character of elastic soundness, as if it were a
living tissue.&nbsp; &ldquo;The man is virtually a
cripple,&rdquo; he added with unmistakable feeling.</p>
<p>Other voices, as if glad of the opening, murmured hasty
compassion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quite startling,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Monstrous,&rdquo; &ldquo;Most painful to see.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The lank man, with the eyeglass on a broad ribbon, pronounced
mincingly the word &ldquo;Grotesque,&rdquo; whose justness was
appreciated by those standing near him.&nbsp; They smiled at each
other.</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner had expressed no opinion either
then or later, his position making it impossible for him to
ventilate any independent view of a ticket-of-leave
convict.&nbsp; But, in truth, he shared the view of his
wife&rsquo;s friend and patron that Michaelis was a humanitarian
sentimentalist, a little mad, but upon the whole incapable of
hurting a fly intentionally.&nbsp; So when that name cropped up
suddenly in this vexing bomb affair he realised all the danger of
it for the ticket-of-leave apostle, and his mind reverted at once
to the old lady&rsquo;s well-established infatuation.&nbsp; Her
arbitrary kindness would not brook patiently any interference
with Michaelis&rsquo; freedom.&nbsp; It was a deep, calm,
convinced infatuation.&nbsp; She had not only felt him to be
inoffensive, but she had said so, which last by a confusion of
her absolutist mind became a sort of incontrovertible
demonstration.&nbsp; It was as if the monstrosity of the man,
with his candid infant&rsquo;s eyes and a fat angelic smile, had
fascinated her.&nbsp; She had come to believe almost his theory
of the future, since it was not repugnant to her
prejudices.&nbsp; She disliked the new element of plutocracy in
the social compound, and industrialism as a method of human
development appeared to her singularly repulsive in its
mechanical and unfeeling character.&nbsp; The humanitarian hopes
of the mild Michaelis tended not towards utter destruction, but
merely towards the complete economic ruin of the system.&nbsp;
And she did not really see where was the moral harm of it.&nbsp;
It would do away with all the multitude of the
&ldquo;parvenus,&rdquo; whom she disliked and mistrusted, not
because they had arrived anywhere (she denied that), but because
of their profound unintelligence of the world, which was the
primary cause of the crudity of their perceptions and the aridity
of their hearts.&nbsp; With the annihilation of all capital they
would vanish too; but universal ruin (providing it was universal,
as it was revealed to Michaelis) would leave the social values
untouched.&nbsp; The disappearance of the last piece of money
could not affect people of position.&nbsp; She could not conceive
how it could affect her position, for instance.&nbsp; She had
developed these discoveries to the Assistant Commissioner with
all the serene fearlessness of an old woman who had escaped the
blight of indifference.&nbsp; He had made for himself the rule to
receive everything of that sort in a silence which he took care
from policy and inclination not to make offensive.&nbsp; He had
an affection for the aged disciple of Michaelis, a complex
sentiment depending a little on her prestige, on her personality,
but most of all on the instinct of flattered gratitude.&nbsp; He
felt himself really liked in her house.&nbsp; She was kindness
personified.&nbsp; And she was practically wise too, after the
manner of experienced women.&nbsp; She made his married life much
easier than it would have been without her generously full
recognition of his rights as Annie&rsquo;s husband.&nbsp; Her
influence upon his wife, a woman devoured by all sorts of small
selfishnesses, small envies, small jealousies, was
excellent.&nbsp; Unfortunately, both her kindness and her wisdom
were of unreasonable complexion, distinctly feminine, and
difficult to deal with.&nbsp; She remained a perfect woman all
along her full tale of years, and not as some of them do
become&mdash;a sort of slippery, pestilential old man in
petticoats.&nbsp; And it was as of a woman that he thought of
her&mdash;the specially choice incarnation of the feminine,
wherein is recruited the tender, ingenuous, and fierce bodyguard
for all sorts of men who talk under the influence of an emotion,
true or fraudulent; for preachers, seers, prophets, or
reformers.</p>
<p>Appreciating the distinguished and good friend of his wife,
and himself, in that way, the Assistant Commissioner became
alarmed at the convict Michaelis&rsquo; possible fate.&nbsp; Once
arrested on suspicion of being in some way, however remote, a
party to this outrage, the man could hardly escape being sent
back to finish his sentence at least.&nbsp; And that would kill
him; he would never come out alive.&nbsp; The Assistant
Commissioner made a reflection extremely unbecoming his official
position without being really creditable to his humanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the fellow is laid hold of again,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;she will never forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frankness of such a secretly outspoken thought could not
go without some derisive self-criticism.&nbsp; No man engaged in
a work he does not like can preserve many saving illusions about
himself.&nbsp; The distaste, the absence of glamour, extend from
the occupation to the personality.&nbsp; It is only when our
appointed activities seem by a lucky accident to obey the
particular earnestness of our temperament that we can taste the
comfort of complete self-deception.&nbsp; The Assistant
Commissioner did not like his work at home.&nbsp; The police work
he had been engaged on in a distant part of the globe had the
saving character of an irregular sort of warfare or at least the
risk and excitement of open-air sport.&nbsp; His real abilities,
which were mainly of an administrative order, were combined with
an adventurous disposition.&nbsp; Chained to a desk in the thick
of four millions of men, he considered himself the victim of an
ironic fate&mdash;the same, no doubt, which had brought about his
marriage with a woman exceptionally sensitive in the matter of
colonial climate, besides other limitations testifying to the
delicacy of her nature&mdash;and her tastes.&nbsp; Though he
judged his alarm sardonically he did not dismiss the improper
thought from his mind.&nbsp; The instinct of self-preservation
was strong within him.&nbsp; On the contrary, he repeated it
mentally with profane emphasis and a fuller precision:
&ldquo;Damn it!&nbsp; If that infernal Heat has his way the
fellow&rsquo;ll die in prison smothered in his fat, and
she&rsquo;ll never forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His black, narrow figure, with the white band of the collar
under the silvery gleams on the close-cropped hair at the back of
the head, remained motionless.&nbsp; The silence had lasted such
a long time that Chief Inspector Heat ventured to clear his
throat.&nbsp; This noise produced its effect.&nbsp; The zealous
and intelligent officer was asked by his superior, whose back
remained turned to him immovably:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You connect Michaelis with this affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Heat was very positive, but cautious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have enough to go
upon.&nbsp; A man like that has no business to be at large,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will want some conclusive evidence,&rdquo; came the
observation in a murmur.</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Heat raised his eyebrows at the black, narrow
back, which remained obstinately presented to his intelligence
and his zeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no difficulty in getting up sufficient
evidence against <i>him</i>,&rdquo; he said, with virtuous
complacency.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may trust me for that, sir,&rdquo;
he added, quite unnecessarily, out of the fulness of his heart;
for it seemed to him an excellent thing to have that man in hand
to be thrown down to the public should it think fit to roar with
any special indignation in this case.&nbsp; It was impossible to
say yet whether it would roar or not.&nbsp; That in the last
instance depended, of course, on the newspaper press.&nbsp; But
in any case, Chief Inspector Heat, purveyor of prisons by trade,
and a man of legal instincts, did logically believe that
incarceration was the proper fate for every declared enemy of the
law.&nbsp; In the strength of that conviction he committed a
fault of tact.&nbsp; He allowed himself a little conceited laugh,
and repeated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me for that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much for the forced calmness under which the
Assistant Commissioner had for upwards of eighteen months
concealed his irritation with the system and the subordinates of
his office.&nbsp; A square peg forced into a round hole, he had
felt like a daily outrage that long established smooth roundness
into which a man of less sharply angular shape would have fitted
himself, with voluptuous acquiescence, after a shrug or
two.&nbsp; What he resented most was just the necessity of taking
so much on trust.&nbsp; At the little laugh of Chief Inspector
Heat&rsquo;s he spun swiftly on his heels, as if whirled away
from the window-pane by an electric shock.&nbsp; He caught on the
latter&rsquo;s face not only the complacency proper to the
occasion lurking under the moustache, but the vestiges of
experimental watchfulness in the round eyes, which had been, no
doubt, fastened on his back, and now met his glance for a second
before the intent character of their stare had the time to change
to a merely startled appearance.</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner of Police had really some
qualifications for his post.&nbsp; Suddenly his suspicion was
awakened.&nbsp; It is but fair to say that his suspicions of the
police methods (unless the police happened to be a semi-military
body organised by himself) was not difficult to arouse.&nbsp; If
it ever slumbered from sheer weariness, it was but lightly; and
his appreciation of Chief Inspector Heat&rsquo;s zeal and
ability, moderate in itself, excluded all notion of moral
confidence.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s up to something,&rdquo; he
exclaimed mentally, and at once became angry.&nbsp; Crossing over
to his desk with headlong strides, he sat down violently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here I am stuck in a litter of paper,&rdquo; he reflected,
with unreasonable resentment, &ldquo;supposed to hold all the
threads in my hands, and yet I can but hold what is put in my
hand, and nothing else.&nbsp; And they can fasten the other ends
of the threads where they please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his head, and turned towards his subordinate a long,
meagre face with the accentuated features of an energetic Don
Quixote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what is it you&rsquo;ve got up your
sleeve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other stared.&nbsp; He stared without winking in a perfect
immobility of his round eyes, as he was used to stare at the
various members of the criminal class when, after being duly
cautioned, they made their statements in the tones of injured
innocence, or false simplicity, or sullen resignation.&nbsp; But
behind that professional and stony fixity there was some surprise
too, for in such a tone, combining nicely the note of contempt
and impatience, Chief Inspector Heat, the right-hand man of the
department, was not used to be addressed.&nbsp; He began in a
procrastinating manner, like a man taken unawares by a new and
unexpected experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve got against that man Michaelis you
mean, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner watched the bullet head; the points
of that Norse rover&rsquo;s moustache, falling below the line of
the heavy jaw; the whole full and pale physiognomy, whose
determined character was marred by too much flesh; at the cunning
wrinkles radiating from the outer corners of the eyes&mdash;and
in that purposeful contemplation of the valuable and trusted
officer he drew a conviction so sudden that it moved him like an
inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have reason to think that when you came into this
room,&rdquo; he said in measured tones, &ldquo;it was not
Michaelis who was in your mind; not principally&mdash;perhaps not
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have reason to think, sir?&rdquo; muttered Chief
Inspector Heat, with every appearance of astonishment, which up
to a certain point was genuine enough.&nbsp; He had discovered in
this affair a delicate and perplexing side, forcing upon the
discoverer a certain amount of insincerity&mdash;that sort of
insincerity which, under the names of skill, prudence,
discretion, turns up at one point or another in most human
affairs.&nbsp; He felt at the moment like a tight-rope artist
might feel if suddenly, in the middle of the performance, the
manager of the Music Hall were to rush out of the proper
managerial seclusion and begin to shake the rope.&nbsp;
Indignation, the sense of moral insecurity engendered by such a
treacherous proceeding joined to the immediate apprehension of a
broken neck, would, in the colloquial phrase, put him in a
state.&nbsp; And there would be also some scandalised concern for
his art too, since a man must identify himself with something
more tangible than his own personality, and establish his pride
somewhere, either in his social position, or in the quality of
the work he is obliged to do, or simply in the superiority of the
idleness he may be fortunate enough to enjoy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Assistant Commissioner; &ldquo;I
have.&nbsp; I do not mean to say that you have not thought of
Michaelis at all.&nbsp; But you are giving the fact you&rsquo;ve
mentioned a prominence which strikes me as not quite candid,
Inspector Heat.&nbsp; If that is really the track of discovery,
why haven&rsquo;t you followed it up at once, either personally
or by sending one of your men to that village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think, sir, I have failed in my duty
there?&rdquo; the Chief Inspector asked, in a tone which he
sought to make simply reflective.&nbsp; Forced unexpectedly to
concentrate his faculties upon the task of preserving his
balance, he had seized upon that point, and exposed himself to a
rebuke; for, the Assistant Commissioner frowning slightly,
observed that this was a very improper remark to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But since you&rsquo;ve made it,&rdquo; he continued
coldly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that this is not my
meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, with a straight glance of his sunken eyes which was
a full equivalent of the unspoken termination &ldquo;and you know
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The head of the so-called Special Crimes
Department debarred by his position from going out of doors
personally in quest of secrets locked up in guilty breasts, had a
propensity to exercise his considerable gifts for the detection
of incriminating truth upon his own subordinates.&nbsp; That
peculiar instinct could hardly be called a weakness.&nbsp; It was
natural.&nbsp; He was a born detective.&nbsp; It had
unconsciously governed his choice of a career, and if it ever
failed him in life it was perhaps in the one exceptional
circumstance of his marriage&mdash;which was also natural.&nbsp;
It fed, since it could not roam abroad, upon the human material
which was brought to it in its official seclusion.&nbsp; We can
never cease to be ourselves.</p>
<p>His elbow on the desk, his thin legs crossed, and nursing his
cheek in the palm of his meagre hand, the Assistant Commissioner
in charge of the Special Crimes branch was getting hold of the
case with growing interest.&nbsp; His Chief Inspector, if not an
absolutely worthy foeman of his penetration, was at any rate the
most worthy of all within his reach.&nbsp; A mistrust of
established reputations was strictly in character with the
Assistant Commissioner&rsquo;s ability as detector.&nbsp; His
memory evoked a certain old fat and wealthy native chief in the
distant colony whom it was a tradition for the successive
Colonial Governors to trust and make much of as a firm friend and
supporter of the order and legality established by white men;
whereas, when examined sceptically, he was found out to be
principally his own good friend, and nobody else&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Not precisely a traitor, but still a man of many dangerous
reservations in his fidelity, caused by a due regard for his own
advantage, comfort, and safety.&nbsp; A fellow of some innocence
in his naive duplicity, but none the less dangerous.&nbsp; He
took some finding out.&nbsp; He was physically a big man, too,
and (allowing for the difference of colour, of course) Chief
Inspector Heat&rsquo;s appearance recalled him to the memory of
his superior.&nbsp; It was not the eyes nor yet the lips
exactly.&nbsp; It was bizarre.&nbsp; But does not Alfred Wallace
relate in his famous book on the Malay Archipelago how, amongst
the Aru Islanders, he discovered in an old and naked savage with
a sooty skin a peculiar resemblance to a dear friend at home?</p>
<p>For the first time since he took up his appointment the
Assistant Commissioner felt as if he were going to do some real
work for his salary.&nbsp; And that was a pleasurable
sensation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn him inside out like an
old glove,&rdquo; thought the Assistant Commissioner, with his
eyes resting pensively upon Chief Inspector Heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that was not my thought,&rdquo; he began
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no doubt about you knowing your
business&mdash;no doubt at all; and that&rsquo;s precisely why
I&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He stopped short, and changing his tone:
&ldquo;What could you bring up against Michaelis of a definite
nature?&nbsp; I mean apart from the fact that the two men under
suspicion&mdash;you&rsquo;re certain there were two of
them&mdash;came last from a railway station within three miles of
the village where Michaelis is living now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This by itself is enough for us to go upon, sir, with
that sort of man,&rdquo; said the Chief Inspector, with returning
composure.&nbsp; The slight approving movement of the Assistant
Commissioner&rsquo;s head went far to pacify the resentful
astonishment of the renowned officer.&nbsp; For Chief Inspector
Heat was a kind man, an excellent husband, a devoted father; and
the public and departmental confidence he enjoyed acting
favourably upon an amiable nature, disposed him to feel friendly
towards the successive Assistant Commissioners he had seen pass
through that very room.&nbsp; There had been three in his
time.&nbsp; The first one, a soldierly, abrupt, red-faced person,
with white eyebrows and an explosive temper, could be managed
with a silken thread.&nbsp; He left on reaching the age
limit.&nbsp; The second, a perfect gentleman, knowing his own and
everybody else&rsquo;s place to a nicety, on resigning to take up
a higher appointment out of England got decorated for (really)
Inspector Heat&rsquo;s services.&nbsp; To work with him had been
a pride and a pleasure.&nbsp; The third, a bit of a dark horse
from the first, was at the end of eighteen months something of a
dark horse still to the department.&nbsp; Upon the whole Chief
Inspector Heat believed him to be in the main
harmless&mdash;odd-looking, but harmless.&nbsp; He was speaking
now, and the Chief Inspector listened with outward deference
(which means nothing, being a matter of duty) and inwardly with
benevolent toleration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michaelis reported himself before leaving London for
the country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; He did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may he be doing there?&rdquo; continued the
Assistant Commissioner, who was perfectly informed on that
point.&nbsp; Fitted with painful tightness into an old wooden
arm-chair, before a worm-eaten oak table in an upstairs room of a
four-roomed cottage with a roof of moss-grown tiles, Michaelis
was writing night and day in a shaky, slanting hand that
&ldquo;Autobiography of a Prisoner&rdquo; which was to be like a
book of Revelation in the history of mankind.&nbsp; The
conditions of confined space, seclusion, and solitude in a small
four-roomed cottage were favourable to his inspiration.&nbsp; It
was like being in prison, except that one was never disturbed for
the odious purpose of taking exercise according to the tyrannical
regulations of his old home in the penitentiary.&nbsp; He could
not tell whether the sun still shone on the earth or not.&nbsp;
The perspiration of the literary labour dropped from his
brow.&nbsp; A delightful enthusiasm urged him on.&nbsp; It was
the liberation of his inner life, the letting out of his soul
into the wide world.&nbsp; And the zeal of his guileless vanity
(first awakened by the offer of five hundred pounds from a
publisher) seemed something predestined and holy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be, of course, most desirable to be informed
exactly,&rdquo; insisted the Assistant Commissioner
uncandidly.</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Heat, conscious of renewed irritation at this
display of scrupulousness, said that the county police had been
notified from the first of Michaelis&rsquo; arrival, and that a
full report could be obtained in a few hours.&nbsp; A wire to the
superintendent&mdash;</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, rather slowly, while his mind seemed already to
be weighing the consequences.&nbsp; A slight knitting of the brow
was the outward sign of this.&nbsp; But he was interrupted by a
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sent that wire already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he answered, as if surprised.</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner uncrossed his legs suddenly.&nbsp;
The briskness of that movement contrasted with the casual way in
which he threw out a suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you think that Michaelis had anything to do with
the preparation of that bomb, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief Inspector assumed a reflective manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say so.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
necessity to say anything at present.&nbsp; He associates with
men who are classed as dangerous.&nbsp; He was made a delegate of
the Red Committee less than a year after his release on
licence.&nbsp; A sort of compliment, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Chief Inspector laughed a little angrily, a little
scornfully.&nbsp; With a man of that sort scrupulousness was a
misplaced and even an illegal sentiment.&nbsp; The celebrity
bestowed upon Michaelis on his release two years ago by some
emotional journalists in want of special copy had rankled ever
since in his breast.&nbsp; It was perfectly legal to arrest that
man on the barest suspicion.&nbsp; It was legal and expedient on
the face of it.&nbsp; His two former chiefs would have seen the
point at once; whereas this one, without saying either yes or no,
sat there, as if lost in a dream.&nbsp; Moreover, besides being
legal and expedient, the arrest of Michaelis solved a little
personal difficulty which worried Chief Inspector Heat
somewhat.&nbsp; This difficulty had its bearing upon his
reputation, upon his comfort, and even upon the efficient
performance of his duties.&nbsp; For, if Michaelis no doubt knew
something about this outrage, the Chief Inspector was fairly
certain that he did not know too much.&nbsp; This was just as
well.&nbsp; He knew much less&mdash;the Chief Inspector was
positive&mdash;than certain other individuals he had in his mind,
but whose arrest seemed to him inexpedient, besides being a more
complicated matter, on account of the rules of the game.&nbsp;
The rules of the game did not protect so much Michaelis, who was
an ex-convict.&nbsp; It would be stupid not to take advantage of
legal facilities, and the journalists who had written him up with
emotional gush would be ready to write him down with emotional
indignation.</p>
<p>This prospect, viewed with confidence, had the attraction of a
personal triumph for Chief Inspector Heat.&nbsp; And deep down in
his blameless bosom of an average married citizen, almost
unconscious but potent nevertheless, the dislike of being
compelled by events to meddle with the desperate ferocity of the
Professor had its say.&nbsp; This dislike had been strengthened
by the chance meeting in the lane.&nbsp; The encounter did not
leave behind with Chief Inspector Heat that satisfactory sense of
superiority the members of the police force get from the
unofficial but intimate side of their intercourse with the
criminal classes, by which the vanity of power is soothed, and
the vulgar love of domination over our fellow-creatures is
flattered as worthily as it deserves.</p>
<p>The perfect anarchist was not recognised as a fellow-creature
by Chief Inspector Heat.&nbsp; He was impossible&mdash;a mad dog
to be left alone.&nbsp; Not that the Chief Inspector was afraid
of him; on the contrary, he meant to have him some day.&nbsp; But
not yet; he meant to get hold of him in his own time, properly
and effectively according to the rules of the game.&nbsp; The
present was not the right time for attempting that feat, not the
right time for many reasons, personal and of public
service.&nbsp; This being the strong feeling of Inspector Heat,
it appeared to him just and proper that this affair should be
shunted off its obscure and inconvenient track, leading goodness
knows where, into a quiet (and lawful) siding called
Michaelis.&nbsp; And he repeated, as if reconsidering the
suggestion conscientiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bomb.&nbsp; No, I would not say that exactly.&nbsp;
We may never find that out.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s clear that he is
connected with this in some way, which we can find out without
much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His countenance had that look of grave, overbearing
indifference once well known and much dreaded by the better sort
of thieves.&nbsp; Chief Inspector Heat, though what is called a
man, was not a smiling animal.&nbsp; But his inward state was
that of satisfaction at the passively receptive attitude of the
Assistant Commissioner, who murmured gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you really think that the investigation should be
made in that direction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite convinced?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, sir.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the true line for us to
take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner withdrew the support of his hand
from his reclining head with a suddenness that, considering his
languid attitude, seemed to menace his whole person with
collapse.&nbsp; But, on the contrary, he sat up, extremely alert,
behind the great writing-table on which his hand had fallen with
the sound of a sharp blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I want to know is what put it out of your head
till now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it out of my head,&rdquo; repeated the Chief
Inspector very slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Till you were called into this
room&mdash;you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief Inspector felt as if the air between his clothing
and his skin had become unpleasantly hot.&nbsp; It was the
sensation of an unprecedented and incredible experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, exaggerating the
deliberation of his utterance to the utmost limits of
possibility, &ldquo;if there is a reason, of which I know
nothing, for not interfering with the convict Michaelis, perhaps
it&rsquo;s just as well I didn&rsquo;t start the county police
after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This took such a long time to say that the unflagging
attention of the Assistant Commissioner seemed a wonderful feat
of endurance.&nbsp; His retort came without delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No reason whatever that I know of.&nbsp; Come, Chief
Inspector, this finessing with me is highly improper on your
part&mdash;highly improper.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s also unfair, you
know.&nbsp; You shouldn&rsquo;t leave me to puzzle things out for
myself like this.&nbsp; Really, I am surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, then added smoothly: &ldquo;I need scarcely tell
you that this conversation is altogether unofficial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words were far from pacifying the Chief Inspector.&nbsp;
The indignation of a betrayed tight-rope performer was strong
within him.&nbsp; In his pride of a trusted servant he was
affected by the assurance that the rope was not shaken for the
purpose of breaking his neck, as by an exhibition of
impudence.&nbsp; As if anybody were afraid!&nbsp; Assistant
Commissioners come and go, but a valuable Chief Inspector is not
an ephemeral office phenomenon.&nbsp; He was not afraid of
getting a broken neck.&nbsp; To have his performance spoiled was
more than enough to account for the glow of honest
indignation.&nbsp; And as thought is no respecter of persons, the
thought of Chief Inspector Heat took a threatening and prophetic
shape.&nbsp; &ldquo;You, my boy,&rdquo; he said to himself,
keeping his round and habitually roving eyes fastened upon the
Assistant Commissioner&rsquo;s face&mdash;&ldquo;you, my boy, you
don&rsquo;t know your place, and your place won&rsquo;t know you
very long either, I bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in provoking answer to that thought, something like the
ghost of an amiable smile passed on the lips of the Assistant
Commissioner.&nbsp; His manner was easy and business-like while
he persisted in administering another shake to the tight
rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us come now to what you have discovered on the
spot, Chief Inspector,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fool and his job are soon parted,&rdquo; went on the
train of prophetic thought in Chief Inspector Heat&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; But it was immediately followed by the reflection
that a higher official, even when &ldquo;fired out&rdquo; (this
was the precise image), has still the time as he flies through
the door to launch a nasty kick at the shin-bones of a
subordinate.&nbsp; Without softening very much the basilisk
nature of his stare, he said impassively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are coming to that part of my investigation,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; Well, what have you brought
away from it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief Inspector, who had made up his mind to jump off the
rope, came to the ground with gloomy frankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought away an address,&rdquo; he said,
pulling out of his pocket without haste a singed rag of dark blue
cloth.&nbsp; &ldquo;This belongs to the overcoat the fellow who
got himself blown to pieces was wearing.&nbsp; Of course, the
overcoat may not have been his, and may even have been
stolen.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s not at all probable if you look at
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief Inspector, stepping up to the table, smoothed out
carefully the rag of blue cloth.&nbsp; He had picked it up from
the repulsive heap in the mortuary, because a tailor&rsquo;s name
is found sometimes under the collar.&nbsp; It is not often of
much use, but still&mdash;He only half expected to find anything
useful, but certainly he did not expect to find&mdash;not under
the collar at all, but stitched carefully on the under side of
the lapel&mdash;a square piece of calico with an address written
on it in marking ink.</p>
<p>The Chief Inspector removed his smoothing hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I carried it off with me without anybody taking
notice,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought it best.&nbsp; It
can always be produced if required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner, rising a little in his chair,
pulled the cloth over to his side of the table.&nbsp; He sat
looking at it in silence.&nbsp; Only the number 32 and the name
of Brett Street were written in marking ink on a piece of calico
slightly larger than an ordinary cigarette paper.&nbsp; He was
genuinely surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t understand why he should have gone about
labelled like this,&rdquo; he said, looking up at Chief Inspector
Heat.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a most extraordinary
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met once in the smoking-room of a hotel an old
gentleman who went about with his name and address sewn on in all
his coats in case of an accident or sudden illness,&rdquo; said
the Chief Inspector.&nbsp; &ldquo;He professed to be eighty-four
years old, but he didn&rsquo;t look his age.&nbsp; He told me he
was also afraid of losing his memory suddenly, like those people
he has been reading of in the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A question from the Assistant Commissioner, who wanted to know
what was No. 32 Brett Street, interrupted that reminiscence
abruptly.&nbsp; The Chief Inspector, driven down to the ground by
unfair artifices, had elected to walk the path of unreserved
openness.&nbsp; If he believed firmly that to know too much was
not good for the department, the judicious holding back of
knowledge was as far as his loyalty dared to go for the good of
the service.&nbsp; If the Assistant Commissioner wanted to
mismanage this affair nothing, of course, could prevent
him.&nbsp; But, on his own part, he now saw no reason for a
display of alacrity.&nbsp; So he answered concisely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shop, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner, with his eyes lowered on the rag
of blue cloth, waited for more information.&nbsp; As that did not
come he proceeded to obtain it by a series of questions
propounded with gentle patience.&nbsp; Thus he acquired an idea
of the nature of Mr Verloc&rsquo;s commerce, of his personal
appearance, and heard at last his name.&nbsp; In a pause the
Assistant Commissioner raised his eyes, and discovered some
animation on the Chief Inspector&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; They looked
at each other in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;the
department has no record of that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did any of my predecessors have any knowledge of what
you have told me now?&rdquo; asked the Assistant Commissioner,
putting his elbows on the table and raising his joined hands
before his face, as if about to offer prayer, only that his eyes
had not a pious expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; certainly not.&nbsp; What would have been the
object?&nbsp; That sort of man could never be produced publicly
to any good purpose.&nbsp; It was sufficient for me to know who
he was, and to make use of him in a way that could be used
publicly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think that sort of private knowledge
consistent with the official position you occupy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly, sir.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s quite
proper.&nbsp; I will take the liberty to tell you, sir, that it
makes me what I am&mdash;and I am looked upon as a man who knows
his work.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a private affair of my own.&nbsp; A
personal friend of mine in the French police gave me the hint
that the fellow was an Embassy spy.&nbsp; Private friendship,
private information, private use of it&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I
look upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner after remarking to himself that the
mental state of the renowned Chief Inspector seemed to affect the
outline of his lower jaw, as if the lively sense of his high
professional distinction had been located in that part of his
anatomy, dismissed the point for the moment with a calm &ldquo;I
see.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then leaning his cheek on his joined hands:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then&mdash;speaking privately if you
like&mdash;how long have you been in private touch with this
Embassy spy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this inquiry the private answer of the Chief Inspector, so
private that it was never shaped into audible words, was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long before you were even thought of for your place
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The so-to-speak public utterance was much more precise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him for the first time in my life a little more
than seven years ago, when two Imperial Highnesses and the
Imperial Chancellor were on a visit here.&nbsp; I was put in
charge of all the arrangements for looking after them.&nbsp;
Baron Stott-Wartenheim was Ambassador then.&nbsp; He was a very
nervous old gentleman.&nbsp; One evening, three days before the
Guildhall Banquet, he sent word that he wanted to see me for a
moment.&nbsp; I was downstairs, and the carriages were at the
door to take the Imperial Highnesses and the Chancellor to the
opera.&nbsp; I went up at once.&nbsp; I found the Baron walking
up and down his bedroom in a pitiable state of distress,
squeezing his hands together.&nbsp; He assured me he had the
fullest confidence in our police and in my abilities, but he had
there a man just come over from Paris whose information could be
trusted implicity.&nbsp; He wanted me to hear what that man had
to say.&nbsp; He took me at once into a dressing-room next door,
where I saw a big fellow in a heavy overcoat sitting all alone on
a chair, and holding his hat and stick in one hand.&nbsp; The
Baron said to him in French &lsquo;Speak, my friend.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The light in that room was not very good.&nbsp; I talked with him
for some five minutes perhaps.&nbsp; He certainly gave me a piece
of very startling news.&nbsp; Then the Baron took me aside
nervously to praise him up to me, and when I turned round again I
discovered that the fellow had vanished like a ghost.&nbsp; Got
up and sneaked out down some back stairs, I suppose.&nbsp; There
was no time to run after him, as I had to hurry off after the
Ambassador down the great staircase, and see the party started
safe for the opera.&nbsp; However, I acted upon the information
that very night.&nbsp; Whether it was perfectly correct or not,
it did look serious enough.&nbsp; Very likely it saved us from an
ugly trouble on the day of the Imperial visit to the City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time later, a month or so after my promotion to
Chief Inspector, my attention was attracted to a big burly man, I
thought I had seen somewhere before, coming out in a hurry from a
jeweller&rsquo;s shop in the Strand.&nbsp; I went after him, as
it was on my way towards Charing Cross, and there seeing one of
our detectives across the road, I beckoned him over, and pointed
out the fellow to him, with instructions to watch his movements
for a couple of days, and then report to me.&nbsp; No later than
next afternoon my man turned up to tell me that the fellow had
married his landlady&rsquo;s daughter at a registrar&rsquo;s
office that very day at 11.30 a.m., and had gone off with her to
Margate for a week.&nbsp; Our man had seen the luggage being put
on the cab.&nbsp; There were some old Paris labels on one of the
bags.&nbsp; Somehow I couldn&rsquo;t get the fellow out of my
head, and the very next time I had to go to Paris on service I
spoke about him to that friend of mine in the Paris police.&nbsp;
My friend said: &lsquo;From what you tell me I think you must
mean a rather well-known hanger-on and emissary of the
Revolutionary Red Committee.&nbsp; He says he is an Englishman by
birth.&nbsp; We have an idea that he has been for a good few
years now a secret agent of one of the foreign Embassies in
London.&rsquo;&nbsp; This woke up my memory completely.&nbsp; He
was the vanishing fellow I saw sitting on a chair in Baron
Stott-Wartenheim&rsquo;s bathroom.&nbsp; I told my friend that he
was quite right.&nbsp; The fellow was a secret agent to my
certain knowledge.&nbsp; Afterwards my friend took the trouble to
ferret out the complete record of that man for me.&nbsp; I
thought I had better know all there was to know; but I
don&rsquo;t suppose you want to hear his history now,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner shook his supported head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The history of your relations with that useful personage
is the only thing that matters just now,&rdquo; he said, closing
slowly his weary, deep-set eyes, and then opening them swiftly
with a greatly refreshed glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing official about them,&rdquo; said
the Chief Inspector bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I went into his shop
one evening, told him who I was, and reminded him of our first
meeting.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t as much as twitch an
eyebrow.&nbsp; He said that he was married and settled now, and
that all he wanted was not to be interfered in his little
business.&nbsp; I took it upon myself to promise him that, as
long as he didn&rsquo;t go in for anything obviously outrageous,
he would be left alone by the police.&nbsp; That was worth
something to him, because a word from us to the Custom-House
people would have been enough to get some of these packages he
gets from Paris and Brussels opened in Dover, with confiscation
to follow for certain, and perhaps a prosecution as well at the
end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very precarious trade,&rdquo; murmured
the Assistant Commissioner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did he go in for
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief Inspector raised scornful eyebrows
dispassionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely got a connection&mdash;friends on the
Continent&mdash;amongst people who deal in such wares.&nbsp; They
would be just the sort he would consort with.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a
lazy dog, too&mdash;like the rest of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you get from him in exchange for your
protection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief Inspector was not inclined to enlarge on the value
of Mr Verloc&rsquo;s services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would not be much good to anybody but myself.&nbsp;
One has got to know a good deal beforehand to make use of a man
like that.&nbsp; I can understand the sort of hint he can
give.&nbsp; And when I want a hint he can generally furnish it to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief Inspector lost himself suddenly in a discreet
reflective mood; and the Assistant Commissioner repressed a smile
at the fleeting thought that the reputation of Chief Inspector
Heat might possibly have been made in a great part by the Secret
Agent Verloc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a more general way of being of use, all our men of
the Special Crimes section on duty at Charing Cross and Victoria
have orders to take careful notice of anybody they may see with
him.&nbsp; He meets the new arrivals frequently, and afterwards
keeps track of them.&nbsp; He seems to have been told off for
that sort of duty.&nbsp; When I want an address in a hurry, I can
always get it from him.&nbsp; Of course, I know how to manage our
relations.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t seen him to speak to three times
in the last two years.&nbsp; I drop him a line, unsigned, and he
answers me in the same way at my private address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From time to time the Assistant Commissioner gave an almost
imperceptible nod.&nbsp; The Chief Inspector added that he did
not suppose Mr Verloc to be deep in the confidence of the
prominent members of the Revolutionary International Council, but
that he was generally trusted of that there could be no
doubt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whenever I&rsquo;ve had reason to think there
was something in the wind,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always found he could tell me something worth knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner made a significant remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He failed you this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither had I wind of anything in any other way,&rdquo;
retorted Chief Inspector Heat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I asked him nothing,
so he could tell me nothing.&nbsp; He isn&rsquo;t one of our
men.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t as if he were in our pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; muttered the Assistant Commissioner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a spy in the pay of a foreign government.&nbsp;
We could never confess to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must do my work in my own way,&rdquo; declared the
Chief Inspector.&nbsp; &ldquo;When it comes to that I would deal
with the devil himself, and take the consequences.&nbsp; There
are things not fit for everybody to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your idea of secrecy seems to consist in keeping the
chief of your department in the dark.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
stretching it perhaps a little too far, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; He
lives over his shop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;Verloc?&nbsp; Oh yes.&nbsp; He lives over his
shop.&nbsp; The wife&rsquo;s mother, I fancy, lives with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the house watched?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; Certain
people who come there are watched.&nbsp; My opinion is that he
knows nothing of this affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you account for this?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Assistant
Commissioner nodded at the cloth rag lying before him on the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t account for it at all, sir.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s simply unaccountable.&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t be
explained by what I know.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Chief Inspector made
those admissions with the frankness of a man whose reputation is
established as if on a rock.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any rate not at this
present moment.&nbsp; I think that the man who had most to do
with it will turn out to be Michaelis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; because I can answer for all the
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that other man supposed to have escaped from
the park?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think he&rsquo;s far away by this time,&rdquo;
opined the Chief Inspector.</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner looked hard at him, and rose
suddenly, as though having made up his mind to some course of
action.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, he had that very moment
succumbed to a fascinating temptation.&nbsp; The Chief Inspector
heard himself dismissed with instructions to meet his superior
early next morning for further consultation upon the case.&nbsp;
He listened with an impenetrable face, and walked out of the room
with measured steps.</p>
<p>Whatever might have been the plans of the Assistant
Commissioner they had nothing to do with that desk work, which
was the bane of his existence because of its confined nature and
apparent lack of reality.&nbsp; It could not have had, or else
the general air of alacrity that came upon the Assistant
Commissioner would have been inexplicable.&nbsp; As soon as he
was left alone he looked for his hat impulsively, and put it on
his head.&nbsp; Having done that, he sat down again to reconsider
the whole matter.&nbsp; But as his mind was already made up, this
did not take long.&nbsp; And before Chief Inspector Heat had gone
very far on the way home, he also left the building.</p>
