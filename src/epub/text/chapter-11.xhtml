<p>After Chief Inspector Heat had left him Mr Verloc moved about
the parlour.</p>
<p>From time to time he eyed his wife through the open
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;She knows all about it now,&rdquo; he thought
to himself with commiseration for her sorrow and with some
satisfaction as regarded himself.&nbsp; Mr Verloc&rsquo;s soul,
if lacking greatness perhaps, was capable of tender
sentiments.&nbsp; The prospect of having to break the news to her
had put him into a fever.&nbsp; Chief Inspector Heat had relieved
him of the task.&nbsp; That was good as far as it went.&nbsp; It
remained for him now to face her grief.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc had never expected to have to face it on account of
death, whose catastrophic character cannot be argued away by
sophisticated reasoning or persuasive eloquence.&nbsp; Mr Verloc
never meant Stevie to perish with such abrupt violence.&nbsp; He
did not mean him to perish at all.&nbsp; Stevie dead was a much
greater nuisance than ever he had been when alive.&nbsp; Mr
Verloc had augured a favourable issue to his enterprise, basing
himself not on Stevie&rsquo;s intelligence, which sometimes plays
queer tricks with a man, but on the blind docility and on the
blind devotion of the boy.&nbsp; Though not much of a
psychologist, Mr Verloc had gauged the depth of Stevie&rsquo;s
fanaticism.&nbsp; He dared cherish the hope of Stevie walking
away from the walls of the Observatory as he had been instructed
to do, taking the way shown to him several times previously, and
rejoining his brother-in-law, the wise and good Mr Verloc,
outside the precincts of the park.&nbsp; Fifteen minutes ought to
have been enough for the veriest fool to deposit the engine and
walk away.&nbsp; And the Professor had guaranteed more than
fifteen minutes.&nbsp; But Stevie had stumbled within five
minutes of being left to himself.&nbsp; And Mr Verloc was shaken
morally to pieces.&nbsp; He had foreseen everything but
that.&nbsp; He had foreseen Stevie distracted and
lost&mdash;sought for&mdash;found in some police station or
provincial workhouse in the end.&nbsp; He had foreseen Stevie
arrested, and was not afraid, because Mr Verloc had a great
opinion of Stevie&rsquo;s loyalty, which had been carefully
indoctrinated with the necessity of silence in the course of many
walks.&nbsp; Like a peripatetic philosopher, Mr Verloc, strolling
along the streets of London, had modified Stevie&rsquo;s view of
the police by conversations full of subtle reasonings.&nbsp;
Never had a sage a more attentive and admiring disciple.&nbsp;
The submission and worship were so apparent that Mr Verloc had
come to feel something like a liking for the boy.&nbsp; In any
case, he had not foreseen the swift bringing home of his
connection.&nbsp; That his wife should hit upon the precaution of
sewing the boy&rsquo;s address inside his overcoat was the last
thing Mr Verloc would have thought of.&nbsp; One can&rsquo;t
think of everything.&nbsp; That was what she meant when she said
that he need not worry if he lost Stevie during their
walks.&nbsp; She had assured him that the boy would turn up all
right.&nbsp; Well, he had turned up with a vengeance!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; muttered Mr Verloc in his
wonder.&nbsp; What did she mean by it?&nbsp; Spare him the
trouble of keeping an anxious eye on Stevie?&nbsp; Most likely
she had meant well.&nbsp; Only she ought to have told him of the
precaution she had taken.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc walked behind the counter of the shop.&nbsp; His
intention was not to overwhelm his wife with bitter
reproaches.&nbsp; Mr Verloc felt no bitterness.&nbsp; The
unexpected march of events had converted him to the doctrine of
fatalism.&nbsp; Nothing could be helped now.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean any harm to come to the
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc shuddered at the sound of her husband&rsquo;s
voice.&nbsp; She did not uncover her face.&nbsp; The trusted
secret agent of the late Baron Stott-Wartenheim looked at her for
a time with a heavy, persistent, undiscerning glance.&nbsp; The
torn evening paper was lying at her feet.&nbsp; It could not have
told her much.&nbsp; Mr Verloc felt the need of talking to his
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that damned Heat&mdash;eh?&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He upset you.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a brute,
blurting it out like this to a woman.&nbsp; I made myself ill
thinking how to break it to you.&nbsp; I sat for hours in the
little parlour of Cheshire Cheese thinking over the best
way.&nbsp; You understand I never meant any harm to come to that
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc, the Secret Agent, was speaking the truth.&nbsp; It
was his marital affection that had received the greatest shock
from the premature explosion.&nbsp; He added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel particularly gay sitting there and
thinking of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He observed another slight shudder of his wife, which affected
his sensibility.&nbsp; As she persisted in hiding her face in her
hands, he thought he had better leave her alone for a
while.&nbsp; On this delicate impulse Mr Verloc withdrew into the
parlour again, where the gas jet purred like a contented
cat.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s wifely forethought had left the
cold beef on the table with carving knife and fork and half a
loaf of bread for Mr Verloc&rsquo;s supper.&nbsp; He noticed all
these things now for the first time, and cutting himself a piece
of bread and meat, began to eat.</p>
<p>His appetite did not proceed from callousness.&nbsp; Mr Verloc
had not eaten any breakfast that day.&nbsp; He had left his home
fasting.&nbsp; Not being an energetic man, he found his
resolution in nervous excitement, which seemed to hold him mainly
by the throat.&nbsp; He could not have swallowed anything
solid.&nbsp; Michaelis&rsquo; cottage was as destitute of
provisions as the cell of a prisoner.&nbsp; The ticket-of-leave
apostle lived on a little milk and crusts of stale bread.&nbsp;
Moreover, when Mr Verloc arrived he had already gone upstairs
after his frugal meal.&nbsp; Absorbed in the toil and delight of
literary composition, he had not even answered Mr Verloc&rsquo;s
shout up the little staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am taking this young fellow home for a day or
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, in truth, Mr Verloc did not wait for an answer, but had
marched out of the cottage at once, followed by the obedient
Stevie.</p>
<p>Now that all action was over and his fate taken out of his
hands with unexpected swiftness, Mr Verloc felt terribly empty
physically.&nbsp; He carved the meat, cut the bread, and devoured
his supper standing by the table, and now and then casting a
glance towards his wife.&nbsp; Her prolonged immobility disturbed
the comfort of his refection.&nbsp; He walked again into the
shop, and came up very close to her.&nbsp; This sorrow with a
veiled face made Mr Verloc uneasy.&nbsp; He expected, of course,
his wife to be very much upset, but he wanted her to pull herself
together.&nbsp; He needed all her assistance and all her loyalty
in these new conjunctures his fatalism had already accepted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; he said in a tone of
gloomy sympathy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, Winnie, we&rsquo;ve got to
think of to-morrow.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll want all your wits about
you after I am taken away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s breast heaved
convulsively.&nbsp; This was not reassuring to Mr Verloc, in
whose view the newly created situation required from the two
people most concerned in it calmness, decision, and other
qualities incompatible with the mental disorder of passionate
sorrow.&nbsp; Mr Verloc was a humane man; he had come home
prepared to allow every latitude to his wife&rsquo;s affection
for her brother.</p>
<p>Only he did not understand either the nature or the whole
extent of that sentiment.&nbsp; And in this he was excusable,
since it was impossible for him to understand it without ceasing
to be himself.&nbsp; He was startled and disappointed, and his
speech conveyed it by a certain roughness of tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might look at a fellow,&rdquo; he observed after
waiting a while.</p>
<p>As if forced through the hands covering Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s
face the answer came, deadened, almost pitiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to look at you as long as I
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; What!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr Verloc was merely
startled by the superficial and literal meaning of this
declaration.&nbsp; It was obviously unreasonable, the mere cry of
exaggerated grief.&nbsp; He threw over it the mantle of his
marital indulgence.&nbsp; The mind of Mr Verloc lacked
profundity.&nbsp; Under the mistaken impression that the value of
individuals consists in what they are in themselves, he could not
possibly comprehend the value of Stevie in the eyes of Mrs
Verloc.&nbsp; She was taking it confoundedly hard, he thought to
himself.&nbsp; It was all the fault of that damned Heat.&nbsp;
What did he want to upset the woman for?&nbsp; But she
mustn&rsquo;t be allowed, for her own good, to carry on so till
she got quite beside herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t sit like this in the
shop,&rdquo; he said with affected severity, in which there was
some real annoyance; for urgent practical matters must be talked
over if they had to sit up all night.&nbsp; &ldquo;Somebody might
come in at any minute,&rdquo; he added, and waited again.&nbsp;
No effect was produced, and the idea of the finality of death
occurred to Mr Verloc during the pause.&nbsp; He changed his
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come.&nbsp; This won&rsquo;t bring him
back,&rdquo; he said gently, feeling ready to take her in his
arms and press her to his breast, where impatience and compassion
dwelt side by side.&nbsp; But except for a short shudder Mrs
Verloc remained apparently unaffected by the force of that
terrible truism.&nbsp; It was Mr Verloc himself who was
moved.&nbsp; He was moved in his simplicity to urge moderation by
asserting the claims of his own personality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do be reasonable, Winnie.&nbsp; What would it have been
if you had lost me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had vaguely expected to hear her cry out.&nbsp; But she did
not budge.&nbsp; She leaned back a little, quieted down to a
complete unreadable stillness.&nbsp; Mr Verloc&rsquo;s heart
began to beat faster with exasperation and something resembling
alarm.&nbsp; He laid his hand on her shoulder, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Winnie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave no sign.&nbsp; It was impossible to talk to any
purpose with a woman whose face one cannot see.&nbsp; Mr Verloc
caught hold of his wife&rsquo;s wrists.&nbsp; But her hands
seemed glued fast.&nbsp; She swayed forward bodily to his tug,
and nearly went off the chair.&nbsp; Startled to feel her so
helplessly limp, he was trying to put her back on the chair when
she stiffened suddenly all over, tore herself out of his hands,
ran out of the shop, across the parlour, and into the
kitchen.&nbsp; This was very swift.&nbsp; He had just a glimpse
of her face and that much of her eyes that he knew she had not
looked at him.</p>
<p>It all had the appearance of a struggle for the possession of
a chair, because Mr Verloc instantly took his wife&rsquo;s place
in it.&nbsp; Mr Verloc did not cover his face with his hands, but
a sombre thoughtfulness veiled his features.&nbsp; A term of
imprisonment could not be avoided.&nbsp; He did not wish now to
avoid it.&nbsp; A prison was a place as safe from certain
unlawful vengeances as the grave, with this advantage, that in a
prison there is room for hope.&nbsp; What he saw before him was a
term of imprisonment, an early release and then life abroad
somewhere, such as he had contemplated already, in case of
failure.&nbsp; Well, it was a failure, if not exactly the sort of
failure he had feared.&nbsp; It had been so near success that he
could have positively terrified Mr Vladimir out of his ferocious
scoffing with this proof of occult efficiency.&nbsp; So at least
it seemed now to Mr Verloc.&nbsp; His prestige with the Embassy
would have been immense if&mdash;if his wife had not had the
unlucky notion of sewing on the address inside Stevie&rsquo;s
overcoat.&nbsp; Mr Verloc, who was no fool, had soon perceived
the extraordinary character of the influence he had over Stevie,
though he did not understand exactly its origin&mdash;the
doctrine of his supreme wisdom and goodness inculcated by two
anxious women.&nbsp; In all the eventualities he had foreseen Mr
Verloc had calculated with correct insight on Stevie&rsquo;s
instinctive loyalty and blind discretion.&nbsp; The eventuality
he had not foreseen had appalled him as a humane man and a fond
husband.&nbsp; From every other point of view it was rather
advantageous.&nbsp; Nothing can equal the everlasting discretion
of death.&nbsp; Mr Verloc, sitting perplexed and frightened in
the small parlour of the Cheshire Cheese, could not help
acknowledging that to himself, because his sensibility did not
stand in the way of his judgment.&nbsp; Stevie&rsquo;s violent
disintegration, however disturbing to think about, only assured
the success; for, of course, the knocking down of a wall was not
the aim of Mr Vladimir&rsquo;s menaces, but the production of a
moral effect.&nbsp; With much trouble and distress on Mr
Verloc&rsquo;s part the effect might be said to have been
produced.&nbsp; When, however, most unexpectedly, it came home to
roost in Brett Street, Mr Verloc, who had been struggling like a
man in a nightmare for the preservation of his position, accepted
the blow in the spirit of a convinced fatalist.&nbsp; The
position was gone through no one&rsquo;s fault really.&nbsp; A
small, tiny fact had done it.&nbsp; It was like slipping on a bit
of orange peel in the dark and breaking your leg.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc drew a weary breath.&nbsp; He nourished no
resentment against his wife.&nbsp; He thought: She will have to
look after the shop while they keep me locked up.&nbsp; And
thinking also how cruelly she would miss Stevie at first, he felt
greatly concerned about her health and spirits.&nbsp; How would
she stand her solitude&mdash;absolutely alone in that
house?&nbsp; It would not do for her to break down while he was
locked up?&nbsp; What would become of the shop then?&nbsp; The
shop was an asset.&nbsp; Though Mr Verloc&rsquo;s fatalism
accepted his undoing as a secret agent, he had no mind to be
utterly ruined, mostly, it must be owned, from regard for his
wife.</p>
<p>Silent, and out of his line of sight in the kitchen, she
frightened him.&nbsp; If only she had had her mother with
her.&nbsp; But that silly old woman&mdash;An angry dismay
possessed Mr Verloc.&nbsp; He must talk with his wife.&nbsp; He
could tell her certainly that a man does get desperate under
certain circumstances.&nbsp; But he did not go incontinently to
impart to her that information.&nbsp; First of all, it was clear
to him that this evening was no time for business.&nbsp; He got
up to close the street door and put the gas out in the shop.</p>
<p>Having thus assured a solitude around his hearthstone Mr
Verloc walked into the parlour, and glanced down into the
kitchen.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc was sitting in the place where poor
Stevie usually established himself of an evening with paper and
pencil for the pastime of drawing these coruscations of
innumerable circles suggesting chaos and eternity.&nbsp; Her arms
were folded on the table, and her head was lying on her
arms.&nbsp; Mr Verloc contemplated her back and the arrangement
of her hair for a time, then walked away from the kitchen
door.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s philosophical, almost disdainful
incuriosity, the foundation of their accord in domestic life made
it extremely difficult to get into contact with her, now this
tragic necessity had arisen.&nbsp; Mr Verloc felt this difficulty
acutely.&nbsp; He turned around the table in the parlour with his
usual air of a large animal in a cage.</p>
<p>Curiosity being one of the forms of self-revelation, a
systematically incurious person remains always partly
mysterious.&nbsp; Every time he passed near the door Mr Verloc
glanced at his wife uneasily.&nbsp; It was not that he was afraid
of her.&nbsp; Mr Verloc imagined himself loved by that
woman.&nbsp; But she had not accustomed him to make
confidences.&nbsp; And the confidence he had to make was of a
profound psychological order.&nbsp; How with his want of practice
could he tell her what he himself felt but vaguely: that there
are conspiracies of fatal destiny, that a notion grows in a mind
sometimes till it acquires an outward existence, an independent
power of its own, and even a suggestive voice?&nbsp; He could not
inform her that a man may be haunted by a fat, witty,
clean-shaved face till the wildest expedient to get rid of it
appears a child of wisdom.</p>
<p>On this mental reference to a First Secretary of a great
Embassy, Mr Verloc stopped in the doorway, and looking down into
the kitchen with an angry face and clenched fists, addressed his
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what a brute I had to deal
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started off to make another perambulation of the table;
then when he had come to the door again he stopped, glaring in
from the height of two steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A silly, jeering, dangerous brute, with no more sense
than&mdash;After all these years!&nbsp; A man like me!&nbsp; And
I have been playing my head at that game.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; Quite right, too.&nbsp; What was the good of telling
you that I stood the risk of having a knife stuck into me any
time these seven years we&rsquo;ve been married?&nbsp; I am not a
chap to worry a woman that&rsquo;s fond of me.&nbsp; You had no
business to know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr Verloc took another turn round
the parlour, fuming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A venomous beast,&rdquo; he began again from the
doorway.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drive me out into a ditch to starve for a
joke.&nbsp; I could see he thought it was a damned good
joke.&nbsp; A man like me!&nbsp; Look here!&nbsp; Some of the
highest in the world got to thank me for walking on their two
legs to this day.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the man you&rsquo;ve got
married to, my girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He perceived that his wife had sat up.&nbsp; Mrs
Verloc&rsquo;s arms remained lying stretched on the table.&nbsp;
Mr Verloc watched at her back as if he could read there the
effect of his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a murdering plot for the last eleven
years that I hadn&rsquo;t my finger in at the risk of my
life.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s scores of these revolutionists
I&rsquo;ve sent off, with their bombs in their blamed pockets, to
get themselves caught on the frontier.&nbsp; The old Baron knew
what I was worth to his country.&nbsp; And here suddenly a swine
comes along&mdash;an ignorant, overbearing swine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc, stepping slowly down two steps, entered the
kitchen, took a tumbler off the dresser, and holding it in his
hand, approached the sink, without looking at his wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the old Baron who would have had the
wicked folly of getting me to call on him at eleven in the
morning.&nbsp; There are two or three in this town that, if they
had seen me going in, would have made no bones about knocking me
on the head sooner or later.&nbsp; It was a silly, murderous
trick to expose for nothing a man&mdash;like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc, turning on the tap above the sink, poured three
glasses of water, one after another, down his throat to quench
the fires of his indignation.&nbsp; Mr Vladimir&rsquo;s conduct
was like a hot brand which set his internal economy in a
blaze.&nbsp; He could not get over the disloyalty of it.&nbsp;
This man, who would not work at the usual hard tasks which
society sets to its humbler members, had exercised his secret
industry with an indefatigable devotion.&nbsp; There was in Mr
Verloc a fund of loyalty.&nbsp; He had been loyal to his
employers, to the cause of social stability,&mdash;and to his
affections too&mdash;as became apparent when, after standing the
tumbler in the sink, he turned about, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t thought of you I would have taken the
bullying brute by the throat and rammed his head into the
fireplace.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have been more than a match for that
pink-faced, smooth-shaved&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc, neglected to finish the sentence, as if there could
be no doubt of the terminal word.&nbsp; For the first time in his
life he was taking that incurious woman into his
confidence.&nbsp; The singularity of the event, the force and
importance of the personal feelings aroused in the course of this
confession, drove Stevie&rsquo;s fate clean out of Mr
Verloc&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; The boy&rsquo;s stuttering existence
of fears and indignations, together with the violence of his end,
had passed out of Mr Verloc&rsquo;s mental sight for a
time.&nbsp; For that reason, when he looked up he was startled by
the inappropriate character of his wife&rsquo;s stare.&nbsp; It
was not a wild stare, and it was not inattentive, but its
attention was peculiar and not satisfactory, inasmuch that it
seemed concentrated upon some point beyond Mr Verloc&rsquo;s
person.&nbsp; The impression was so strong that Mr Verloc glanced
over his shoulder.&nbsp; There was nothing behind him: there was
just the whitewashed wall.&nbsp; The excellent husband of Winnie
Verloc saw no writing on the wall.&nbsp; He turned to his wife
again, repeating, with some emphasis:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have taken him by the throat.&nbsp; As true as
I stand here, if I hadn&rsquo;t thought of you then I would have
half choked the life out of the brute before I let him get
up.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t you think he would have been anxious to
call the police either.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t have dared.&nbsp;
You understand why&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He blinked at his wife knowingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs Verloc in an unresonant voice, and
without looking at him at all.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you talking
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great discouragement, the result of fatigue, came upon Mr
Verloc.&nbsp; He had had a very full day, and his nerves had been
tried to the utmost.&nbsp; After a month of maddening worry,
ending in an unexpected catastrophe, the storm-tossed spirit of
Mr Verloc longed for repose.&nbsp; His career as a secret agent
had come to an end in a way no one could have foreseen; only,
now, perhaps he could manage to get a night&rsquo;s sleep at
last.&nbsp; But looking at his wife, he doubted it.&nbsp; She was
taking it very hard&mdash;not at all like herself, he
thought.&nbsp; He made an effort to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to pull yourself together, my
girl,&rdquo; he said sympathetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
done can&rsquo;t be undone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc gave a slight start, though not a muscle of her
white face moved in the least.&nbsp; Mr Verloc, who was not
looking at her, continued ponderously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go to bed now.&nbsp; What you want is a good
cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This opinion had nothing to recommend it but the general
consent of mankind.&nbsp; It is universally understood that, as
if it were nothing more substantial than vapour floating in the
sky, every emotion of a woman is bound to end in a shower.&nbsp;
And it is very probable that had Stevie died in his bed under her
despairing gaze, in her protecting arms, Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s grief
would have found relief in a flood of bitter and pure
tears.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc, in common with other human beings, was
provided with a fund of unconscious resignation sufficient to
meet the normal manifestation of human destiny.&nbsp; Without
&ldquo;troubling her head about it,&rdquo; she was aware that it
&ldquo;did not stand looking into very much.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
lamentable circumstances of Stevie&rsquo;s end, which to Mr
Verloc&rsquo;s mind had only an episodic character, as part of a
greater disaster, dried her tears at their very source.&nbsp; It
was the effect of a white-hot iron drawn across her eyes; at the
same time her heart, hardened and chilled into a lump of ice,
kept her body in an inward shudder, set her features into a
frozen contemplative immobility addressed to a whitewashed wall
with no writing on it.&nbsp; The exigencies of Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s
temperament, which, when stripped of its philosophical reserve,
was maternal and violent, forced her to roll a series of thoughts
in her motionless head.&nbsp; These thoughts were rather imagined
than expressed.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc was a woman of singularly few
words, either for public or private use.&nbsp; With the rage and
dismay of a betrayed woman, she reviewed the tenor of her life in
visions concerned mostly with Stevie&rsquo;s difficult existence
from its earliest days.&nbsp; It was a life of single purpose and
of a noble unity of inspiration, like those rare lives that have
left their mark on the thoughts and feelings of mankind.&nbsp;
But the visions of Mrs Verloc lacked nobility and
magnificence.&nbsp; She saw herself putting the boy to bed by the
light of a single candle on the deserted top floor of a
&ldquo;business house,&rdquo; dark under the roof and
scintillating exceedingly with lights and cut glass at the level
of the street like a fairy palace.&nbsp; That meretricious
splendour was the only one to be met in Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s
visions.&nbsp; She remembered brushing the boy&rsquo;s hair and
tying his pinafores&mdash;herself in a pinafore still; the
consolations administered to a small and badly scared creature by
another creature nearly as small but not quite so badly scared;
she had the vision of the blows intercepted (often with her own
head), of a door held desperately shut against a man&rsquo;s rage
(not for very long); of a poker flung once (not very far), which
stilled that particular storm into the dumb and awful silence
which follows a thunder-clap.&nbsp; And all these scenes of
violence came and went accompanied by the unrefined noise of deep
vociferations proceeding from a man wounded in his paternal
pride, declaring himself obviously accursed since one of his kids
was a &ldquo;slobbering idjut and the other a wicked
she-devil.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was of her that this had been said
many years ago.</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc heard the words again in a ghostly fashion, and
then the dreary shadow of the Belgravian mansion descended upon
her shoulders.&nbsp; It was a crushing memory, an exhausting
vision of countless breakfast trays carried up and down
innumerable stairs, of endless haggling over pence, of the
endless drudgery of sweeping, dusting, cleaning, from basement to
attics; while the impotent mother, staggering on swollen legs,
cooked in a grimy kitchen, and poor Stevie, the unconscious
presiding genius of all their toil, blacked the gentlemen&rsquo;s
boots in the scullery.&nbsp; But this vision had a breath of a
hot London summer in it, and for a central figure a young man
wearing his Sunday best, with a straw hat on his dark head and a
wooden pipe in his mouth.&nbsp; Affectionate and jolly, he was a
fascinating companion for a voyage down the sparkling stream of
life; only his boat was very small.&nbsp; There was room in it
for a girl-partner at the oar, but no accommodation for
passengers.&nbsp; He was allowed to drift away from the threshold
of the Belgravian mansion while Winnie averted her tearful
eyes.&nbsp; He was not a lodger.&nbsp; The lodger was Mr Verloc,
indolent, and keeping late hours, sleepily jocular of a morning
from under his bed-clothes, but with gleams of infatuation in his
heavy lidded eyes, and always with some money in his
pockets.&nbsp; There was no sparkle of any kind on the lazy
stream of his life.&nbsp; It flowed through secret places.&nbsp;
But his barque seemed a roomy craft, and his taciturn magnanimity
accepted as a matter of course the presence of passengers.</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc pursued the visions of seven years&rsquo; security
for Stevie, loyally paid for on her part; of security growing
into confidence, into a domestic feeling, stagnant and deep like
a placid pool, whose guarded surface hardly shuddered on the
occasional passage of Comrade Ossipon, the robust anarchist with
shamelessly inviting eyes, whose glance had a corrupt clearness
sufficient to enlighten any woman not absolutely imbecile.</p>
<p>A few seconds only had elapsed since the last word had been
uttered aloud in the kitchen, and Mrs Verloc was staring already
at the vision of an episode not more than a fortnight old.&nbsp;
With eyes whose pupils were extremely dilated she stared at the
vision of her husband and poor Stevie walking up Brett Street
side by side away from the shop.&nbsp; It was the last scene of
an existence created by Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s genius; an existence
foreign to all grace and charm, without beauty and almost without
decency, but admirable in the continuity of feeling and tenacity
of purpose.&nbsp; And this last vision had such plastic relief,
such nearness of form, such a fidelity of suggestive detail, that
it wrung from Mrs Verloc an anguished and faint murmur,
reproducing the supreme illusion of her life, an appalled murmur
that died out on her blanched lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have been father and son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc stopped, and raised a care-worn face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; What did you say?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;
Receiving no reply, he resumed his sinister tramping.&nbsp; Then
with a menacing flourish of a thick, fleshy fist, he burst
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; The Embassy people.&nbsp; A pretty lot,
ain&rsquo;t they!&nbsp; Before a week&rsquo;s out I&rsquo;ll make
some of them wish themselves twenty feet underground.&nbsp;
Eh?&nbsp; What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced sideways, with his head down.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc
gazed at the whitewashed wall.&nbsp; A blank wall&mdash;perfectly
blank.&nbsp; A blankness to run at and dash your head
against.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc remained immovably seated.&nbsp; She
kept still as the population of half the globe would keep still
in astonishment and despair, were the sun suddenly put out in the
summer sky by the perfidy of a trusted providence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Embassy,&rdquo; Mr Verloc began again, after a
preliminary grimace which bared his teeth wolfishly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish I could get loose in there with a cudgel for
half-an-hour.&nbsp; I would keep on hitting till there
wasn&rsquo;t a single unbroken bone left amongst the whole
lot.&nbsp; But never mind, I&rsquo;ll teach them yet what it
means trying to throw out a man like me to rot in the
streets.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a tongue in my head.&nbsp; All the
world shall know what I&rsquo;ve done for them.&nbsp; I am not
afraid.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; Everything&rsquo;ll come
out.&nbsp; Every damned thing.&nbsp; Let them look
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these terms did Mr Verloc declare his thirst for
revenge.&nbsp; It was a very appropriate revenge.&nbsp; It was in
harmony with the promptings of Mr Verloc&rsquo;s genius.&nbsp; It
had also the advantage of being within the range of his powers
and of adjusting itself easily to the practice of his life, which
had consisted precisely in betraying the secret and unlawful
proceedings of his fellow-men.&nbsp; Anarchists or diplomats were
all one to him.&nbsp; Mr Verloc was temperamentally no respecter
of persons.&nbsp; His scorn was equally distributed over the
whole field of his operations.&nbsp; But as a member of a
revolutionary proletariat&mdash;which he undoubtedly was&mdash;he
nourished a rather inimical sentiment against social
distinction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing on earth can stop me now,&rdquo; he added, and
paused, looking fixedly at his wife, who was looking fixedly at a
blank wall.</p>
<p>The silence in the kitchen was prolonged, and Mr Verloc felt
disappointed.&nbsp; He had expected his wife to say
something.&nbsp; But Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s lips, composed in their
usual form, preserved a statuesque immobility like the rest of
her face.&nbsp; And Mr Verloc was disappointed.&nbsp; Yet the
occasion did not, he recognised, demand speech from her.&nbsp;
She was a woman of very few words.&nbsp; For reasons involved in
the very foundation of his psychology, Mr Verloc was inclined to
put his trust in any woman who had given herself to him.&nbsp;
Therefore he trusted his wife.&nbsp; Their accord was perfect,
but it was not precise.&nbsp; It was a tacit accord, congenial to
Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s incuriosity and to Mr Verloc&rsquo;s habits of
mind, which were indolent and secret.&nbsp; They refrained from
going to the bottom of facts and motives.</p>
<p>This reserve, expressing, in a way, their profound confidence
in each other, introduced at the same time a certain element of
vagueness into their intimacy.&nbsp; No system of conjugal
relations is perfect.&nbsp; Mr Verloc presumed that his wife had
understood him, but he would have been glad to hear her say what
she thought at the moment.&nbsp; It would have been a
comfort.</p>
<p>There were several reasons why this comfort was denied
him.&nbsp; There was a physical obstacle: Mrs Verloc had no
sufficient command over her voice.&nbsp; She did not see any
alternative between screaming and silence, and instinctively she
chose the silence.&nbsp; Winnie Verloc was temperamentally a
silent person.&nbsp; And there was the paralysing atrocity of the
thought which occupied her.&nbsp; Her cheeks were blanched, her
lips ashy, her immobility amazing.&nbsp; And she thought without
looking at Mr Verloc: &ldquo;This man took the boy away to murder
him.&nbsp; He took the boy away from his home to murder
him.&nbsp; He took the boy away from me to murder him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s whole being was racked by that inconclusive
and maddening thought.&nbsp; It was in her veins, in her bones,
in the roots of her hair.&nbsp; Mentally she assumed the biblical
attitude of mourning&mdash;the covered face, the rent garments;
the sound of wailing and lamentation filled her head.&nbsp; But
her teeth were violently clenched, and her tearless eyes were hot
with rage, because she was not a submissive creature.&nbsp; The
protection she had extended over her brother had been in its
origin of a fierce and indignant complexion.&nbsp; She had to love
him with a militant love.&nbsp; She had battled for
him&mdash;even against herself.&nbsp; His loss had the bitterness
of defeat, with the anguish of a baffled passion.&nbsp; It was
not an ordinary stroke of death.&nbsp; Moreover, it was not death
that took Stevie from her.&nbsp; It was Mr Verloc who took him
away.&nbsp; She had seen him.&nbsp; She had watched him, without
raising a hand, take the boy away.&nbsp; And she had let him go,
like&mdash;like a fool&mdash;a blind fool.&nbsp; Then after he
had murdered the boy he came home to her.&nbsp; Just came home
like any other man would come home to his wife. . . .</p>
<p>Through her set teeth Mrs Verloc muttered at the wall:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I thought he had caught a cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc heard these words and appropriated them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was nothing,&rdquo; he said moodily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was upset.&nbsp; I was upset on your account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc, turning her head slowly, transferred her stare
from the wall to her husband&rsquo;s person.&nbsp; Mr Verloc,
with the tips of his fingers between his lips, was looking on the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; he mumbled, letting his
hand fall.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must pull yourself together.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll want all your wits about you.&nbsp; It is you who
brought the police about our ears.&nbsp; Never mind, I
won&rsquo;t say anything more about it,&rdquo; continued Mr
Verloc magnanimously.&nbsp; &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; breathed out Mrs Verloc.&nbsp;
It was as if a corpse had spoken.&nbsp; Mr Verloc took up the
thread of his discourse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make them sit
up.&nbsp; Once under lock and key it will be safe enough for me
to talk&mdash;you understand.&nbsp; You must reckon on me being
two years away from you,&rdquo; he continued, in a tone of
sincere concern.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be easier for you than for
me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have something to do, while I&mdash;Look
here, Winnie, what you must do is to keep this business going for
two years.&nbsp; You know enough for that.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve a
good head on you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send you word when it&rsquo;s
time to go about trying to sell.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to be
extra careful.&nbsp; The comrades will be keeping an eye on you
all the time.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to be as artful as you know
how, and as close as the grave.&nbsp; No one must know what you
are going to do.&nbsp; I have no mind to get a knock on the head
or a stab in the back directly I am let out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus spoke Mr Verloc, applying his mind with ingenuity and
forethought to the problems of the future.&nbsp; His voice was
sombre, because he had a correct sentiment of the
situation.&nbsp; Everything which he did not wish to pass had
come to pass.&nbsp; The future had become precarious.&nbsp; His
judgment, perhaps, had been momentarily obscured by his dread of
Mr Vladimir&rsquo;s truculent folly.&nbsp; A man somewhat over
forty may be excusably thrown into considerable disorder by the
prospect of losing his employment, especially if the man is a
secret agent of political police, dwelling secure in the
consciousness of his high value and in the esteem of high
personages.&nbsp; He was excusable.</p>
<p>Now the thing had ended in a crash.&nbsp; Mr Verloc was cool;
but he was not cheerful.&nbsp; A secret agent who throws his
secrecy to the winds from desire of vengeance, and flaunts his
achievements before the public eye, becomes the mark for
desperate and bloodthirsty indignations.&nbsp; Without unduly
exaggerating the danger, Mr Verloc tried to bring it clearly
before his wife&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; He repeated that he had no
intention to let the revolutionists do away with him.</p>
<p>He looked straight into his wife&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; The
enlarged pupils of the woman received his stare into their
unfathomable depths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am too fond of you for that,&rdquo; he said, with a
little nervous laugh.</p>
<p>A faint flush coloured Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s ghastly and
motionless face.&nbsp; Having done with the visions of the past,
she had not only heard, but had also understood the words uttered
by her husband.&nbsp; By their extreme disaccord with her mental
condition these words produced on her a slightly suffocating
effect.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s mental condition had the merit
of simplicity; but it was not sound.&nbsp; It was governed too
much by a fixed idea.&nbsp; Every nook and cranny of her brain
was filled with the thought that this man, with whom she had
lived without distaste for seven years, had taken the &ldquo;poor
boy&rdquo; away from her in order to kill him&mdash;the man to
whom she had grown accustomed in body and mind; the man whom she
had trusted, took the boy away to kill him!&nbsp; In its form, in
its substance, in its effect, which was universal, altering even
the aspect of inanimate things, it was a thought to sit still and
marvel at for ever and ever.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc sat still.&nbsp;
And across that thought (not across the kitchen) the form of Mr
Verloc went to and fro, familiarly in hat and overcoat, stamping
with his boots upon her brain.&nbsp; He was probably talking too;
but Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s thought for the most part covered the
voice.</p>
<p>Now and then, however, the voice would make itself
heard.&nbsp; Several connected words emerged at times.&nbsp;
Their purport was generally hopeful.&nbsp; On each of these
occasions Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s dilated pupils, losing their far-off
fixity, followed her husband&rsquo;s movements with the effect of
black care and impenetrable attention.&nbsp; Well informed upon
all matters relating to his secret calling, Mr Verloc augured
well for the success of his plans and combinations.&nbsp; He
really believed that it would be upon the whole easy for him to
escape the knife of infuriated revolutionists.&nbsp; He had
exaggerated the strength of their fury and the length of their
arm (for professional purposes) too often to have many illusions
one way or the other.&nbsp; For to exaggerate with judgment one
must begin by measuring with nicety.&nbsp; He knew also how much
virtue and how much infamy is forgotten in two years&mdash;two
long years.&nbsp; His first really confidential discourse to his
wife was optimistic from conviction.&nbsp; He also thought it
good policy to display all the assurance he could muster.&nbsp;
It would put heart into the poor woman.&nbsp; On his liberation,
which, harmonising with the whole tenor of his life, would be
secret, of course, they would vanish together without loss of
time.&nbsp; As to covering up the tracks, he begged his wife to
trust him for that.&nbsp; He knew how it was to be done so that
the devil himself&mdash;</p>
<p>He waved his hand.&nbsp; He seemed to boast.&nbsp; He wished
only to put heart into her.&nbsp; It was a benevolent intention,
but Mr Verloc had the misfortune not to be in accord with his
audience.</p>
<p>The self-confident tone grew upon Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s ear which
let most of the words go by; for what were words to her
now?&nbsp; What could words do to her, for good or evil in the
face of her fixed idea?&nbsp; Her black glance followed that man
who was asserting his impunity&mdash;the man who had taken poor
Stevie from home to kill him somewhere.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc could
not remember exactly where, but her heart began to beat very
perceptibly.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc, in a soft and conjugal tone, was now expressing his
firm belief that there were yet a good few years of quiet life
before them both.&nbsp; He did not go into the question of
means.&nbsp; A quiet life it must be and, as it were, nestling in
the shade, concealed among men whose flesh is grass; modest, like
the life of violets.&nbsp; The words used by Mr Verloc were:
&ldquo;Lie low for a bit.&rdquo;&nbsp; And far from England, of
course.&nbsp; It was not clear whether Mr Verloc had in his mind
Spain or South America; but at any rate somewhere abroad.</p>
<p>This last word, falling into Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s ear, produced
a definite impression.&nbsp; This man was talking of going
abroad.&nbsp; The impression was completely disconnected; and
such is the force of mental habit that Mrs Verloc at once and
automatically asked herself: &ldquo;And what of
Stevie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a sort of forgetfulness; but instantly she became aware
that there was no longer any occasion for anxiety on that
score.&nbsp; There would never be any occasion any more.&nbsp;
The poor boy had been taken out and killed.&nbsp; The poor boy
was dead.</p>
<p>This shaking piece of forgetfulness stimulated Mrs
Verloc&rsquo;s intelligence.&nbsp; She began to perceive certain
consequences which would have surprised Mr Verloc.&nbsp; There
was no need for her now to stay there, in that kitchen, in that
house, with that man&mdash;since the boy was gone for ever.&nbsp;
No need whatever.&nbsp; And on that Mrs Verloc rose as if raised
by a spring.&nbsp; But neither could she see what there was to
keep her in the world at all.&nbsp; And this inability arrested
her.&nbsp; Mr Verloc watched her with marital solicitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking more like yourself,&rdquo; he said
uneasily.&nbsp; Something peculiar in the blackness of his
wife&rsquo;s eyes disturbed his optimism.&nbsp; At that precise
moment Mrs Verloc began to look upon herself as released from all
earthly ties.</p>
<p>She had her freedom.&nbsp; Her contract with existence, as
represented by that man standing over there, was at an end.&nbsp;
She was a free woman.&nbsp; Had this view become in some way
perceptible to Mr Verloc he would have been extremely
shocked.&nbsp; In his affairs of the heart Mr Verloc had been
always carelessly generous, yet always with no other idea than
that of being loved for himself.&nbsp; Upon this matter, his
ethical notions being in agreement with his vanity, he was
completely incorrigible.&nbsp; That this should be so in the case
of his virtuous and legal connection he was perfectly
certain.&nbsp; He had grown older, fatter, heavier, in the belief
that he lacked no fascination for being loved for his own
sake.&nbsp; When he saw Mrs Verloc starting to walk out of the
kitchen without a word he was disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to?&rdquo; he called out rather
sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc in the doorway turned at the voice.&nbsp; An
instinct of prudence born of fear, the excessive fear of being
approached and touched by that man, induced her to nod at him
slightly (from the height of two steps), with a stir of the lips
which the conjugal optimism of Mr Verloc took for a wan and
uncertain smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he encouraged her
gruffly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rest and quiet&rsquo;s what you want.&nbsp;
Go on.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t be long before I am with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc, the free woman who had had really no idea where
she was going to, obeyed the suggestion with rigid
steadiness.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc watched her.&nbsp; She disappeared up the
stairs.&nbsp; He was disappointed.&nbsp; There was that within
him which would have been more satisfied if she had been moved to
throw herself upon his breast.&nbsp; But he was generous and
indulgent.&nbsp; Winnie was always undemonstrative and
silent.&nbsp; Neither was Mr Verloc himself prodigal of
endearments and words as a rule.&nbsp; But this was not an
ordinary evening.&nbsp; It was an occasion when a man wants to be
fortified and strengthened by open proofs of sympathy and
affection.&nbsp; Mr Verloc sighed, and put out the gas in the
kitchen.&nbsp; Mr Verloc&rsquo;s sympathy with his wife was
genuine and intense.&nbsp; It almost brought tears into his eyes
as he stood in the parlour reflecting on the loneliness hanging
over her head.&nbsp; In this mood Mr Verloc missed Stevie very
much out of a difficult world.&nbsp; He thought mournfully of his
end.&nbsp; If only that lad had not stupidly destroyed
himself!</p>
<p>The sensation of unappeasable hunger, not unknown after the
strain of a hazardous enterprise to adventurers of tougher fibre
than Mr Verloc, overcame him again.&nbsp; The piece of roast
beef, laid out in the likeness of funereal baked meats for
Stevie&rsquo;s obsequies, offered itself largely to his
notice.&nbsp; And Mr Verloc again partook.&nbsp; He partook
ravenously, without restraint and decency, cutting thick slices
with the sharp carving knife, and swallowing them without
bread.&nbsp; In the course of that refection it occurred to Mr
Verloc that he was not hearing his wife move about the bedroom as
he should have done.&nbsp; The thought of finding her perhaps
sitting on the bed in the dark not only cut Mr Verloc&rsquo;s
appetite, but also took from him the inclination to follow her
upstairs just yet.&nbsp; Laying down the carving knife, Mr Verloc
listened with careworn attention.</p>
<p>He was comforted by hearing her move at last.&nbsp; She walked
suddenly across the room, and threw the window up.&nbsp; After a
period of stillness up there, during which he figured her to
himself with her head out, he heard the sash being lowered
slowly.&nbsp; Then she made a few steps, and sat down.&nbsp;
Every resonance of his house was familiar to Mr Verloc, who was
thoroughly domesticated.&nbsp; When next he heard his
wife&rsquo;s footsteps overhead he knew, as well as if he had
seen her doing it, that she had been putting on her walking
shoes.&nbsp; Mr Verloc wriggled his shoulders slightly at this
ominous symptom, and moving away from the table, stood with his
back to the fireplace, his head on one side, and gnawing
perplexedly at the tips of his fingers.&nbsp; He kept track of
her movements by the sound.&nbsp; She walked here and there
violently, with abrupt stoppages, now before the chest of
drawers, then in front of the wardrobe.&nbsp; An immense load of
weariness, the harvest of a day of shocks and surprises, weighed
Mr Verloc&rsquo;s energies to the ground.</p>
<p>He did not raise his eyes till he heard his wife descending
the stairs.&nbsp; It was as he had guessed.&nbsp; She was dressed
for going out.</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc was a free woman.&nbsp; She had thrown open the
window of the bedroom either with the intention of screaming
Murder!&nbsp; Help! or of throwing herself out.&nbsp; For she did
not exactly know what use to make of her freedom.&nbsp; Her
personality seemed to have been torn into two pieces, whose
mental operations did not adjust themselves very well to each
other.&nbsp; The street, silent and deserted from end to end,
repelled her by taking sides with that man who was so certain of
his impunity.&nbsp; She was afraid to shout lest no one should
come.&nbsp; Obviously no one would come.&nbsp; Her instinct of
self-preservation recoiled from the depth of the fall into that
sort of slimy, deep trench.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc closed the window,
and dressed herself to go out into the street by another
way.&nbsp; She was a free woman.&nbsp; She had dressed herself
thoroughly, down to the tying of a black veil over her
face.&nbsp; As she appeared before him in the light of the
parlour, Mr Verloc observed that she had even her little handbag
hanging from her left wrist. . . . Flying off to her mother, of
course.</p>
<p>The thought that women were wearisome creatures after all
presented itself to his fatigued brain.&nbsp; But he was too
generous to harbour it for more than an instant.&nbsp; This man,
hurt cruelly in his vanity, remained magnanimous in his conduct,
allowing himself no satisfaction of a bitter smile or of a
contemptuous gesture.&nbsp; With true greatness of soul, he only
glanced at the wooden clock on the wall, and said in a perfectly
calm but forcible manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five and twenty minutes past eight, Winnie.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no sense in going over there so late.&nbsp; You
will never manage to get back to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before his extended hand Mrs Verloc had stopped short.&nbsp;
He added heavily: &ldquo;Your mother will be gone to bed before
you get there.&nbsp; This is the sort of news that can
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing was further from Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s thoughts than
going to her mother.&nbsp; She recoiled at the mere idea, and
feeling a chair behind her, she obeyed the suggestion of the
touch, and sat down.&nbsp; Her intention had been simply to get
outside the door for ever.&nbsp; And if this feeling was correct,
its mental form took an unrefined shape corresponding to her
origin and station.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would rather walk the streets
all the days of my life,&rdquo; she thought.&nbsp; But this
creature, whose moral nature had been subjected to a shock of
which, in the physical order, the most violent earthquake of
history could only be a faint and languid rendering, was at the
mercy of mere trifles, of casual contacts.&nbsp; She sat
down.&nbsp; With her hat and veil she had the air of a visitor,
of having looked in on Mr Verloc for a moment.&nbsp; Her instant
docility encouraged him, whilst her aspect of only temporary and
silent acquiescence provoked him a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you, Winnie,&rdquo; he said with authority,
&ldquo;that your place is here this evening.&nbsp; Hang it all!
you brought the damned police high and low about my ears.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t blame you&mdash;but it&rsquo;s your doing all the
same.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better take this confounded hat
off.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t let you go out, old girl,&rdquo; he
added in a softened voice.</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s mind got hold of that declaration with
morbid tenacity.&nbsp; The man who had taken Stevie out from
under her very eyes to murder him in a locality whose name was at
the moment not present to her memory would not allow her go
out.&nbsp; Of course he wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now he had murdered Stevie he would never let her go.&nbsp; He
would want to keep her for nothing.&nbsp; And on this
characteristic reasoning, having all the force of insane logic,
Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s disconnected wits went to work
practically.&nbsp; She could slip by him, open the door, run
out.&nbsp; But he would dash out after her, seize her round the
body, drag her back into the shop.&nbsp; She could scratch, kick,
and bite&mdash;and stab too; but for stabbing she wanted a
knife.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc sat still under her black veil, in her
own house, like a masked and mysterious visitor of impenetrable
intentions.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc&rsquo;s magnanimity was not more than human.&nbsp;
She had exasperated him at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you say something?&nbsp; You have your own
dodges for vexing a man.&nbsp; Oh yes!&nbsp; I know your
deaf-and-dumb trick.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen you at it before
to-day.&nbsp; But just now it won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; And to begin
with, take this damned thing off.&nbsp; One can&rsquo;t tell
whether one is talking to a dummy or to a live woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He advanced, and stretching out his hand, dragged the veil
off, unmasking a still, unreadable face, against which his
nervous exasperation was shattered like a glass bubble flung
against a rock.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; he said,
to cover his momentary uneasiness, and retreated back to his old
station by the mantelpiece.&nbsp; It never entered his head that
his wife could give him up.&nbsp; He felt a little ashamed of
himself, for he was fond and generous.&nbsp; What could he
do?&nbsp; Everything had been said already.&nbsp; He protested
vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens!&nbsp; You know that I hunted high and
low.&nbsp; I ran the risk of giving myself away to find somebody
for that accursed job.&nbsp; And I tell you again I
couldn&rsquo;t find anyone crazy enough or hungry enough.&nbsp;
What do you take me for&mdash;a murderer, or what?&nbsp; The boy
is gone.&nbsp; Do you think I wanted him to blow himself
up?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp; His troubles are over.&nbsp;
Ours are just going to begin, I tell you, precisely because he
did blow himself.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t blame you.&nbsp; But just
try to understand that it was a pure accident; as much an
accident as if he had been run over by a &rsquo;bus while
crossing the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His generosity was not infinite, because he was a human
being&mdash;and not a monster, as Mrs Verloc believed him to
be.&nbsp; He paused, and a snarl lifting his moustaches above a
gleam of white teeth gave him the expression of a reflective
beast, not very dangerous&mdash;a slow beast with a sleek head,
gloomier than a seal, and with a husky voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when it comes to that, it&rsquo;s as much your
doing as mine.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s so.&nbsp; You may glare as much
as you like.&nbsp; I know what you can do in that way.&nbsp;
Strike me dead if I ever would have thought of the lad for that
purpose.&nbsp; It was you who kept on shoving him in my way when
I was half distracted with the worry of keeping the lot of us out
of trouble.&nbsp; What the devil made you?&nbsp; One would think
you were doing it on purpose.&nbsp; And I am damned if I know
that you didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no saying how much of
what&rsquo;s going on you have got hold of on the sly with your
infernal don&rsquo;t-care-a-damn way of looking nowhere in
particular, and saying nothing at all. . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>His husky domestic voice ceased for a while.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc
made no reply.&nbsp; Before that silence he felt ashamed of what
he had said.&nbsp; But as often happens to peaceful men in
domestic tiffs, being ashamed he pushed another point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a devilish way of holding your tongue
sometimes,&rdquo; he began again, without raising his
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Enough to make some men go mad.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s lucky for you that I am not so easily put out as some
of them would be by your deaf-and-dumb sulks.&nbsp; I am fond of
you.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t you go too far.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t
the time for it.&nbsp; We ought to be thinking of what
we&rsquo;ve got to do.&nbsp; And I can&rsquo;t let you go out
to-night, galloping off to your mother with some crazy tale or
other about me.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t have it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you make any mistake about it: if you will have it that I killed
the boy, then you&rsquo;ve killed him as much as I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In sincerity of feeling and openness of statement, these words
went far beyond anything that had ever been said in this home,
kept up on the wages of a secret industry eked out by the sale of
more or less secret wares: the poor expedients devised by a
mediocre mankind for preserving an imperfect society from the
dangers of moral and physical corruption, both secret too of
their kind.&nbsp; They were spoken because Mr Verloc had felt
himself really outraged; but the reticent decencies of this home
life, nestling in a shady street behind a shop where the sun
never shone, remained apparently undisturbed.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc
heard him out with perfect propriety, and then rose from her
chair in her hat and jacket like a visitor at the end of a
call.&nbsp; She advanced towards her husband, one arm extended as
if for a silent leave-taking.&nbsp; Her net veil dangling down by
one end on the left side of her face gave an air of disorderly
formality to her restrained movements.&nbsp; But when she arrived
as far as the hearthrug, Mr Verloc was no longer standing
there.&nbsp; He had moved off in the direction of the sofa,
without raising his eyes to watch the effect of his tirade.&nbsp;
He was tired, resigned in a truly marital spirit.&nbsp; But he
felt hurt in the tender spot of his secret weakness.&nbsp; If she
would go on sulking in that dreadful overcharged
silence&mdash;why then she must.&nbsp; She was a master in that
domestic art.&nbsp; Mr Verloc flung himself heavily upon the
sofa, disregarding as usual the fate of his hat, which, as if
accustomed to take care of itself, made for a safe shelter under
the table.</p>
<p>He was tired.&nbsp; The last particle of his nervous force had
been expended in the wonders and agonies of this day full of
surprising failures coming at the end of a harassing month of
scheming and insomnia.&nbsp; He was tired.&nbsp; A man
isn&rsquo;t made of stone.&nbsp; Hang everything!&nbsp; Mr Verloc
reposed characteristically, clad in his outdoor garments.&nbsp;
One side of his open overcoat was lying partly on the
ground.&nbsp; Mr Verloc wallowed on his back.&nbsp; But he longed
for a more perfect rest&mdash;for sleep&mdash;for a few hours of
delicious forgetfulness.&nbsp; That would come later.&nbsp;
Provisionally he rested.&nbsp; And he thought: &ldquo;I wish she
would give over this damned nonsense.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
exasperating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There must have been something imperfect in Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s
sentiment of regained freedom.&nbsp; Instead of taking the way of
the door she leaned back, with her shoulders against the tablet
of the mantelpiece, as a wayfarer rests against a fence.&nbsp; A
tinge of wildness in her aspect was derived from the black veil
hanging like a rag against her cheek, and from the fixity of her
black gaze where the light of the room was absorbed and lost
without the trace of a single gleam.&nbsp; This woman, capable of
a bargain the mere suspicion of which would have been infinitely
shocking to Mr Verloc&rsquo;s idea of love, remained irresolute,
as if scrupulously aware of something wanting on her part for the
formal closing of the transaction.</p>
<p>On the sofa Mr Verloc wriggled his shoulders into perfect
comfort, and from the fulness of his heart emitted a wish which
was certainly as pious as anything likely to come from such a
source.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to goodness,&rdquo; he growled huskily, &ldquo;I
had never seen Greenwich Park or anything belonging to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The veiled sound filled the small room with its moderate
volume, well adapted to the modest nature of the wish.&nbsp; The
waves of air of the proper length, propagated in accordance with
correct mathematical formulas, flowed around all the inanimate
things in the room, lapped against Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s head as if
it had been a head of stone.&nbsp; And incredible as it may
appear, the eyes of Mrs Verloc seemed to grow still larger.&nbsp;
The audible wish of Mr Verloc&rsquo;s overflowing heart flowed
into an empty place in his wife&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp; Greenwich
Park.&nbsp; A park!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where the boy was
killed.&nbsp; A park&mdash;smashed branches, torn leaves, gravel,
bits of brotherly flesh and bone, all spouting up together in the
manner of a firework.&nbsp; She remembered now what she had
heard, and she remembered it pictorially.&nbsp; They had to
gather him up with the shovel.&nbsp; Trembling all over with
irrepressible shudders, she saw before her the very implement
with its ghastly load scraped up from the ground.&nbsp; Mrs
Verloc closed her eyes desperately, throwing upon that vision the
night of her eyelids, where after a rainlike fall of mangled
limbs the decapitated head of Stevie lingered suspended alone,
and fading out slowly like the last star of a pyrotechnic
display.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Her face was no longer stony.&nbsp; Anybody could have noted
the subtle change on her features, in the stare of her eyes,
giving her a new and startling expression; an expression seldom
observed by competent persons under the conditions of leisure and
security demanded for thorough analysis, but whose meaning could
not be mistaken at a glance.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s doubts as
to the end of the bargain no longer existed; her wits, no longer
disconnected, were working under the control of her will.&nbsp;
But Mr Verloc observed nothing.&nbsp; He was reposing in that
pathetic condition of optimism induced by excess of
fatigue.&nbsp; He did not want any more trouble&mdash;with his
wife too&mdash;of all people in the world.&nbsp; He had been
unanswerable in his vindication.&nbsp; He was loved for
himself.&nbsp; The present phase of her silence he interpreted
favourably.&nbsp; This was the time to make it up with her.&nbsp;
The silence had lasted long enough.&nbsp; He broke it by calling
to her in an undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winnie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered obediently Mrs Verloc the free
woman.&nbsp; She commanded her wits now, her vocal organs; she
felt herself to be in an almost preternaturally perfect control
of every fibre of her body.&nbsp; It was all her own, because the
bargain was at an end.&nbsp; She was clear sighted.&nbsp; She had
become cunning.&nbsp; She chose to answer him so readily for a
purpose.&nbsp; She did not wish that man to change his position
on the sofa which was very suitable to the circumstances.&nbsp;
She succeeded.&nbsp; The man did not stir.&nbsp; But after
answering him she remained leaning negligently against the
mantelpiece in the attitude of a resting wayfarer.&nbsp; She was
unhurried.&nbsp; Her brow was smooth.&nbsp; The head and
shoulders of Mr Verloc were hidden from her by the high side of
the sofa.&nbsp; She kept her eyes fixed on his feet.</p>
<p>She remained thus mysteriously still and suddenly collected
till Mr Verloc was heard with an accent of marital authority, and
moving slightly to make room for her to sit on the edge of the
sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; he said in a peculiar tone, which
might have been the tone of brutality, but was intimately known
to Mrs Verloc as the note of wooing.</p>
<p>She started forward at once, as if she were still a loyal
woman bound to that man by an unbroken contract.&nbsp; Her right
hand skimmed slightly the end of the table, and when she had
passed on towards the sofa the carving knife had vanished without
the slightest sound from the side of the dish.&nbsp; Mr Verloc
heard the creaky plank in the floor, and was content.&nbsp; He
waited.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc was coming.&nbsp; As if the homeless
soul of Stevie had flown for shelter straight to the breast of
his sister, guardian and protector, the resemblance of her face
with that of her brother grew at every step, even to the droop of
the lower lip, even to the slight divergence of the eyes.&nbsp;
But Mr Verloc did not see that.&nbsp; He was lying on his back
and staring upwards.&nbsp; He saw partly on the ceiling and
partly on the wall the moving shadow of an arm with a clenched
hand holding a carving knife.&nbsp; It flickered up and
down.&nbsp; Its movements were leisurely.&nbsp; They were
leisurely enough for Mr Verloc to recognise the limb and the
weapon.</p>
<p>They were leisurely enough for him to take in the full meaning
of the portent, and to taste the flavour of death rising in his
gorge.&nbsp; His wife had gone raving mad&mdash;murdering
mad.&nbsp; They were leisurely enough for the first paralysing
effect of this discovery to pass away before a resolute
determination to come out victorious from the ghastly struggle
with that armed lunatic.&nbsp; They were leisurely enough for Mr
Verloc to elaborate a plan of defence involving a dash behind the
table, and the felling of the woman to the ground with a heavy
wooden chair.&nbsp; But they were not leisurely enough to allow
Mr Verloc the time to move either hand or foot.&nbsp; The knife
was already planted in his breast.&nbsp; It met no resistance on
its way.&nbsp; Hazard has such accuracies.&nbsp; Into that
plunging blow, delivered over the side of the couch, Mrs Verloc
had put all the inheritance of her immemorial and obscure
descent, the simple ferocity of the age of caverns, and the
unbalanced nervous fury of the age of bar-rooms.&nbsp; Mr Verloc,
the Secret Agent, turning slightly on his side with the force of
the blow, expired without stirring a limb, in the muttered sound
of the word &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&rdquo; by way of protest.</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc had let go the knife, and her extraordinary
resemblance to her late brother had faded, had become very
ordinary now.&nbsp; She drew a deep breath, the first easy breath
since Chief Inspector Heat had exhibited to her the labelled
piece of Stevie&rsquo;s overcoat.&nbsp; She leaned forward on her
folded arms over the side of the sofa.&nbsp; She adopted that
easy attitude not in order to watch or gloat over the body of Mr
Verloc, but because of the undulatory and swinging movements of
the parlour, which for some time behaved as though it were at sea
in a tempest.&nbsp; She was giddy but calm.&nbsp; She had become
a free woman with a perfection of freedom which left her nothing
to desire and absolutely nothing to do, since Stevie&rsquo;s
urgent claim on her devotion no longer existed.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc,
who thought in images, was not troubled now by visions, because
she did not think at all.&nbsp; And she did not move.&nbsp; She
was a woman enjoying her complete irresponsibility and endless
leisure, almost in the manner of a corpse.&nbsp; She did not
move, she did not think.&nbsp; Neither did the mortal envelope of
the late Mr Verloc reposing on the sofa.&nbsp; Except for the
fact that Mrs Verloc breathed these two would have been perfect
in accord: that accord of prudent reserve without superfluous
words, and sparing of signs, which had been the foundation of
their respectable home life.&nbsp; For it had been respectable,
covering by a decent reticence the problems that may arise in the
practice of a secret profession and the commerce of shady
wares.&nbsp; To the last its decorum had remained undisturbed by
unseemly shrieks and other misplaced sincerities of
conduct.&nbsp; And after the striking of the blow, this
respectability was continued in immobility and silence.</p>
<p>Nothing moved in the parlour till Mrs Verloc raised her head
slowly and looked at the clock with inquiring mistrust.&nbsp; She
had become aware of a ticking sound in the room.&nbsp; It grew
upon her ear, while she remembered clearly that the clock on the
wall was silent, had no audible tick.&nbsp; What did it mean by
beginning to tick so loudly all of a sudden?&nbsp; Its face
indicated ten minutes to nine.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc cared nothing for
time, and the ticking went on.&nbsp; She concluded it could not
be the clock, and her sullen gaze moved along the walls, wavered,
and became vague, while she strained her hearing to locate the
sound.&nbsp; Tic, tic, tic.</p>
<p>After listening for some time Mrs Verloc lowered her gaze
deliberately on her husband&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; Its attitude of
repose was so home-like and familiar that she could do so without
feeling embarrassed by any pronounced novelty in the phenomena of
her home life.&nbsp; Mr Verloc was taking his habitual
ease.&nbsp; He looked comfortable.</p>
<p>By the position of the body the face of Mr Verloc was not
visible to Mrs Verloc, his widow.&nbsp; Her fine, sleepy eyes,
travelling downward on the track of the sound, became
contemplative on meeting a flat object of bone which protruded a
little beyond the edge of the sofa.&nbsp; It was the handle of
the domestic carving knife with nothing strange about it but its
position at right angles to Mr Verloc&rsquo;s waistcoat and the
fact that something dripped from it.&nbsp; Dark drops fell on the
floorcloth one after another, with a sound of ticking growing
fast and furious like the pulse of an insane clock.&nbsp; At its
highest speed this ticking changed into a continuous sound of
trickling.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc watched that transformation with
shadows of anxiety coming and going on her face.&nbsp; It was a
trickle, dark, swift, thin. . . . Blood!</p>
<p>At this unforeseen circumstance Mrs Verloc abandoned her pose
of idleness and irresponsibility.</p>
<p>With a sudden snatch at her skirts and a faint shriek she ran
to the door, as if the trickle had been the first sign of a
destroying flood.&nbsp; Finding the table in her way she gave it
a push with both hands as though it had been alive, with such
force that it went for some distance on its four legs, making a
loud, scraping racket, whilst the big dish with the joint crashed
heavily on the floor.</p>
<p>Then all became still.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc on reaching the door
had stopped.&nbsp; A round hat disclosed in the middle of the
floor by the moving of the table rocked slightly on its crown in
the wind of her flight.</p>
