<p>The Professor had turned into a street to the left, and walked
along, with his head carried rigidly erect, in a crowd whose
every individual almost overtopped his stunted stature.&nbsp; It
was vain to pretend to himself that he was not
disappointed.&nbsp; But that was mere feeling; the stoicism of
his thought could not be disturbed by this or any other
failure.&nbsp; Next time, or the time after next, a telling
stroke would be delivered&mdash;something really startling&mdash;a blow
fit to open the first crack in the imposing front of the great
edifice of legal conceptions sheltering the atrocious injustice
of society.&nbsp; Of humble origin, and with an appearance really
so mean as to stand in the way of his considerable natural
abilities, his imagination had been fired early by the tales of
men rising from the depths of poverty to positions of authority
and affluence.&nbsp; The extreme, almost ascetic purity of his
thought, combined with an astounding ignorance of worldly
conditions, had set before him a goal of power and prestige to be
attained without the medium of arts, graces, tact,
wealth&mdash;by sheer weight of merit alone.&nbsp; On that view
he considered himself entitled to undisputed success.&nbsp; His
father, a delicate dark enthusiast with a sloping forehead, had
been an itinerant and rousing preacher of some obscure but rigid
Christian sect&mdash;a man supremely confident in the privileges
of his righteousness.&nbsp; In the son, individualist by
temperament, once the science of colleges had replaced thoroughly
the faith of conventicles, this moral attitude translated itself
into a frenzied puritanism of ambition.&nbsp; He nursed it as
something secularly holy.&nbsp; To see it thwarted opened his
eyes to the true nature of the world, whose morality was
artificial, corrupt, and blasphemous.&nbsp; The way of even the
most justifiable revolutions is prepared by personal impulses
disguised into creeds.&nbsp; The Professor&rsquo;s indignation
found in itself a final cause that absolved him from the sin of
turning to destruction as the agent of his ambition.&nbsp; To
destroy public faith in legality was the imperfect formula of his
pedantic fanaticism; but the subconscious conviction that the
framework of an established social order cannot be effectually
shattered except by some form of collective or individual
violence was precise and correct.&nbsp; He was a moral
agent&mdash;that was settled in his mind.&nbsp; By exercising his
agency with ruthless defiance he procured for himself the
appearances of power and personal prestige.&nbsp; That was
undeniable to his vengeful bitterness.&nbsp; It pacified its
unrest; and in their own way the most ardent of revolutionaries
are perhaps doing no more but seeking for peace in common with
the rest of mankind&mdash;the peace of soothed vanity, of
satisfied appetites, or perhaps of appeased conscience.</p>
<p>Lost in the crowd, miserable and undersized, he meditated
confidently on his power, keeping his hand in the left pocket of
his trousers, grasping lightly the india-rubber ball, the supreme
guarantee of his sinister freedom; but after a while he became
disagreeably affected by the sight of the roadway thronged with
vehicles and of the pavement crowded with men and women.&nbsp; He
was in a long, straight street, peopled by a mere fraction of an
immense multitude; but all round him, on and on, even to the
limits of the horizon hidden by the enormous piles of bricks, he
felt the mass of mankind mighty in its numbers.&nbsp; They
swarmed numerous like locusts, industrious like ants, thoughtless
like a natural force, pushing on blind and orderly and absorbed,
impervious to sentiment, to logic, to terror too perhaps.</p>
<p>That was the form of doubt he feared most.&nbsp; Impervious to
fear!&nbsp; Often while walking abroad, when he happened also to
come out of himself, he had such moments of dreadful and sane
mistrust of mankind.&nbsp; What if nothing could move them?&nbsp;
Such moments come to all men whose ambition aims at a direct
grasp upon humanity&mdash;to artists, politicians, thinkers,
reformers, or saints.&nbsp; A despicable emotional state this,
against which solitude fortifies a superior character; and with
severe exultation the Professor thought of the refuge of his
room, with its padlocked cupboard, lost in a wilderness of poor
houses, the hermitage of the perfect anarchist.&nbsp; In order to
reach sooner the point where he could take his omnibus, he turned
brusquely out of the populous street into a narrow and dusky
alley paved with flagstones.&nbsp; On one side the low brick
houses had in their dusty windows the sightless, moribund look of
incurable decay&mdash;empty shells awaiting demolition.&nbsp;
From the other side life had not departed wholly as yet.&nbsp;
Facing the only gas-lamp yawned the cavern of a second-hand
furniture dealer, where, deep in the gloom of a sort of narrow
avenue winding through a bizarre forest of wardrobes, with an
undergrowth tangle of table legs, a tall pier-glass glimmered
like a pool of water in a wood.&nbsp; An unhappy, homeless couch,
accompanied by two unrelated chairs, stood in the open.&nbsp; The
only human being making use of the alley besides the Professor,
coming stalwart and erect from the opposite direction, checked
his swinging pace suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he said, and stood a little on one side
watchfully.</p>
<p>The Professor had already stopped, with a ready half turn
which brought his shoulders very near the other wall.&nbsp; His
right hand fell lightly on the back of the outcast couch, the
left remained purposefully plunged deep in the trousers pocket,
and the roundness of the heavy rimmed spectacles imparted an
owlish character to his moody, unperturbed face.</p>
<p>It was like a meeting in a side corridor of a mansion full of
life.&nbsp; The stalwart man was buttoned up in a dark overcoat,
and carried an umbrella.&nbsp; His hat, tilted back, uncovered a
good deal of forehead, which appeared very white in the
dusk.&nbsp; In the dark patches of the orbits the eyeballs
glimmered piercingly.&nbsp; Long, drooping moustaches, the colour
of ripe corn, framed with their points the square block of his
shaved chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not looking for you,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
<p>The Professor did not stir an inch.&nbsp; The blended noises
of the enormous town sank down to an inarticulate low
murmur.&nbsp; Chief Inspector Heat of the Special Crimes
Department changed his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in a hurry to get home?&rdquo; he asked, with
mocking simplicity.</p>
<p>The unwholesome-looking little moral agent of destruction
exulted silently in the possession of personal prestige, keeping
in check this man armed with the defensive mandate of a menaced
society.&nbsp; More fortunate than Caligula, who wished that the
Roman Senate had only one head for the better satisfaction of his
cruel lust, he beheld in that one man all the forces he had set
at defiance: the force of law, property, oppression, and
injustice.&nbsp; He beheld all his enemies, and fearlessly
confronted them all in a supreme satisfaction of his
vanity.&nbsp; They stood perplexed before him as if before a
dreadful portent.&nbsp; He gloated inwardly over the chance of
this meeting affirming his superiority over all the multitude of
mankind.</p>
<p>It was in reality a chance meeting.&nbsp; Chief Inspector Heat
had had a disagreeably busy day since his department received the
first telegram from Greenwich a little before eleven in the
morning.&nbsp; First of all, the fact of the outrage being
attempted less than a week after he had assured a high official
that no outbreak of anarchist activity was to be apprehended was
sufficiently annoying.&nbsp; If he ever thought himself safe in
making a statement, it was then.&nbsp; He had made that statement
with infinite satisfaction to himself, because it was clear that
the high official desired greatly to hear that very thing.&nbsp;
He had affirmed that nothing of the sort could even be thought of
without the department being aware of it within twenty-four
hours; and he had spoken thus in his consciousness of being the
great expert of his department.&nbsp; He had gone even so far as
to utter words which true wisdom would have kept back.&nbsp; But
Chief Inspector Heat was not very wise&mdash;at least not truly
so.&nbsp; True wisdom, which is not certain of anything in this
world of contradictions, would have prevented him from attaining
his present position.&nbsp; It would have alarmed his superiors,
and done away with his chances of promotion.&nbsp; His promotion
had been very rapid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t one of them, sir, that we
couldn&rsquo;t lay our hands on at any time of night and
day.&nbsp; We know what each of them is doing hour by
hour,&rdquo; he had declared.&nbsp; And the high official had
deigned to smile.&nbsp; This was so obviously the right thing to
say for an officer of Chief Inspector Heat&rsquo;s reputation
that it was perfectly delightful.&nbsp; The high official
believed the declaration, which chimed in with his idea of the
fitness of things.&nbsp; His wisdom was of an official kind, or
else he might have reflected upon a matter not of theory but of
experience that in the close-woven stuff of relations between
conspirator and police there occur unexpected solutions of
continuity, sudden holes in space and time.&nbsp; A given
anarchist may be watched inch by inch and minute by minute, but a
moment always comes when somehow all sight and touch of him are
lost for a few hours, during which something (generally an
explosion) more or less deplorable does happen.&nbsp; But the
high official, carried away by his sense of the fitness of
things, had smiled, and now the recollection of that smile was
very annoying to Chief Inspector Heat, principal expert in
anarchist procedure.</p>
<p>This was not the only circumstance whose recollection
depressed the usual serenity of the eminent specialist.&nbsp;
There was another dating back only to that very morning.&nbsp;
The thought that when called urgently to his Assistant
Commissioner&rsquo;s private room he had been unable to conceal
his astonishment was distinctly vexing.&nbsp; His instinct of a
successful man had taught him long ago that, as a general rule, a
reputation is built on manner as much as on achievement.&nbsp;
And he felt that his manner when confronted with the telegram had
not been impressive.&nbsp; He had opened his eyes widely, and had
exclaimed &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exposing himself thereby to
the unanswerable retort of a finger-tip laid forcibly on the
telegram which the Assistant Commissioner, after reading it
aloud, had flung on the desk.&nbsp; To be crushed, as it were,
under the tip of a forefinger was an unpleasant experience.&nbsp;
Very damaging, too!&nbsp; Furthermore, Chief Inspector Heat was
conscious of not having mended matters by allowing himself to
express a conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing I can tell you at once: none of our lot had
anything to do with this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was strong in his integrity of a good detective, but he saw
now that an impenetrably attentive reserve towards this incident
would have served his reputation better.&nbsp; On the other hand,
he admitted to himself that it was difficult to preserve
one&rsquo;s reputation if rank outsiders were going to take a
hand in the business.&nbsp; Outsiders are the bane of the police
as of other professions.&nbsp; The tone of the Assistant
Commissioner&rsquo;s remarks had been sour enough to set
one&rsquo;s teeth on edge.</p>
<p>And since breakfast Chief Inspector Heat had not managed to
get anything to eat.</p>
<p>Starting immediately to begin his investigation on the spot,
he had swallowed a good deal of raw, unwholesome fog in the
park.&nbsp; Then he had walked over to the hospital; and when the
investigation in Greenwich was concluded at last he had lost his
inclination for food.&nbsp; Not accustomed, as the doctors are,
to examine closely the mangled remains of human beings, he had
been shocked by the sight disclosed to his view when a waterproof
sheet had been lifted off a table in a certain apartment of the
hospital.</p>
<p>Another waterproof sheet was spread over that table in the
manner of a table-cloth, with the corners turned up over a sort
of mound&mdash;a heap of rags, scorched and bloodstained, half
concealing what might have been an accumulation of raw material
for a cannibal feast.&nbsp; It required considerable firmness of
mind not to recoil before that sight.&nbsp; Chief Inspector Heat,
an efficient officer of his department, stood his ground, but for
a whole minute he did not advance.&nbsp; A local constable in
uniform cast a sidelong glance, and said, with stolid
simplicity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all there.&nbsp; Every bit of him.&nbsp; It
was a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had been the first man on the spot after the
explosion.&nbsp; He mentioned the fact again.&nbsp; He had seen
something like a heavy flash of lightning in the fog.&nbsp; At
that time he was standing at the door of the King William Street
Lodge talking to the keeper.&nbsp; The concussion made him tingle
all over.&nbsp; He ran between the trees towards the
Observatory.&nbsp; &ldquo;As fast as my legs would carry
me,&rdquo; he repeated twice.</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Heat, bending forward over the table in a
gingerly and horrified manner, let him run on.&nbsp; The hospital
porter and another man turned down the corners of the cloth, and
stepped aside.&nbsp; The Chief Inspector&rsquo;s eyes searched
the gruesome detail of that heap of mixed things, which seemed to
have been collected in shambles and rag shops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You used a shovel,&rdquo; he remarked, observing a
sprinkling of small gravel, tiny brown bits of bark, and
particles of splintered wood as fine as needles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to in one place,&rdquo; said the stolid
constable.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sent a keeper to fetch a spade.&nbsp;
When he heard me scraping the ground with it he leaned his
forehead against a tree, and was as sick as a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief Inspector, stooping guardedly over the table, fought
down the unpleasant sensation in his throat.&nbsp; The shattering
violence of destruction which had made of that body a heap of
nameless fragments affected his feelings with a sense of ruthless
cruelty, though his reason told him the effect must have been as
swift as a flash of lightning.&nbsp; The man, whoever he was, had
died instantaneously; and yet it seemed impossible to believe
that a human body could have reached that state of disintegration
without passing through the pangs of inconceivable agony.&nbsp;
No physiologist, and still less of a metaphysician, Chief
Inspector Heat rose by the force of sympathy, which is a form of
fear, above the vulgar conception of time.&nbsp;
Instantaneous!&nbsp; He remembered all he had ever read in
popular publications of long and terrifying dreams dreamed in the
instant of waking; of the whole past life lived with frightful
intensity by a drowning man as his doomed head bobs up,
streaming, for the last time.&nbsp; The inexplicable mysteries of
conscious existence beset Chief Inspector Heat till he evolved a
horrible notion that ages of atrocious pain and mental torture
could be contained between two successive winks of an eye.&nbsp;
And meantime the Chief Inspector went on, peering at the table
with a calm face and the slightly anxious attention of an
indigent customer bending over what may be called the by-products
of a butcher&rsquo;s shop with a view to an inexpensive Sunday
dinner.&nbsp; All the time his trained faculties of an excellent
investigator, who scorns no chance of information, followed the
self-satisfied, disjointed loquacity of the constable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fair-haired fellow,&rdquo; the last observed in a
placid tone, and paused.&nbsp; &ldquo;The old woman who spoke to
the sergeant noticed a fair-haired fellow coming out of Maze Hill
Station.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused.&nbsp; &ldquo;And he was a
fair-haired fellow.&nbsp; She noticed two men coming out of the
station after the uptrain had gone on,&rdquo; he continued
slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t tell if they were
together.&nbsp; She took no particular notice of the big one, but
the other was a fair, slight chap, carrying a tin varnish can in
one hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; The constable ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know the woman?&rdquo; muttered the Chief Inspector,
with his eyes fixed on the table, and a vague notion in his mind
of an inquest to be held presently upon a person likely to remain
for ever unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s housekeeper to a retired
publican, and attends the chapel in Park Place sometimes,&rdquo;
the constable uttered weightily, and paused, with another oblique
glance at the table.</p>
<p>Then suddenly: &ldquo;Well, here he is&mdash;all of him I
could see.&nbsp; Fair.&nbsp; Slight&mdash;slight enough.&nbsp;
Look at that foot there.&nbsp; I picked up the legs first, one
after another.&nbsp; He was that scattered you didn&rsquo;t know
where to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The constable paused; the least flicker of an innocent
self-laudatory smile invested his round face with an infantile
expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stumbled,&rdquo; he announced positively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I stumbled once myself, and pitched on my head too, while
running up.&nbsp; Them roots do stick out all about the
place.&nbsp; Stumbled against the root of a tree and fell, and
that thing he was carrying must have gone off right under his
chest, I expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The echo of the words &ldquo;Person unknown&rdquo; repeating
itself in his inner consciousness bothered the Chief Inspector
considerably.&nbsp; He would have liked to trace this affair back
to its mysterious origin for his own information.&nbsp; He was
professionally curious.&nbsp; Before the public he would have
liked to vindicate the efficiency of his department by
establishing the identity of that man.&nbsp; He was a loyal
servant.&nbsp; That, however, appeared impossible.&nbsp; The
first term of the problem was unreadable&mdash;lacked all
suggestion but that of atrocious cruelty.</p>
<p>Overcoming his physical repugnance, Chief Inspector Heat
stretched out his hand without conviction for the salving of his
conscience, and took up the least soiled of the rags.&nbsp; It
was a narrow strip of velvet with a larger triangular piece of
dark blue cloth hanging from it.&nbsp; He held it up to his eyes;
and the police constable spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Velvet collar.&nbsp; Funny the old woman should have
noticed the velvet collar.&nbsp; Dark blue overcoat with a velvet
collar, she has told us.&nbsp; He was the chap she saw, and no
mistake.&nbsp; And here he is all complete, velvet collar and
all.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I missed a single piece as big as
a postage stamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point the trained faculties of the Chief Inspector
ceased to hear the voice of the constable.&nbsp; He moved to one
of the windows for better light.&nbsp; His face, averted from the
room, expressed a startled intense interest while he examined
closely the triangular piece of broad-cloth.&nbsp; By a sudden
jerk he detached it, and <i>only</i> after stuffing it into his
pocket turned round to the room, and flung the velvet collar back
on the table&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cover up,&rdquo; he directed the attendants curtly,
without another look, and, saluted by the constable, carried off
his spoil hastily.</p>
<p>A convenient train whirled him up to town, alone and pondering
deeply, in a third-class compartment.&nbsp; That singed piece of
cloth was incredibly valuable, and he could not defend himself
from astonishment at the casual manner it had come into his
possession.&nbsp; It was as if Fate had thrust that clue into his
hands.&nbsp; And after the manner of the average man, whose
ambition is to command events, he began to mistrust such a
gratuitous and accidental success&mdash;just because it seemed
forced upon him.&nbsp; The practical value of success depends not
a little on the way you look at it.&nbsp; But Fate looks at
nothing.&nbsp; It has no discretion.&nbsp; He no longer
considered it eminently desirable all round to establish publicly
the identity of the man who had blown himself up that morning
with such horrible completeness.&nbsp; But he was not certain of
the view his department would take.&nbsp; A department is to
those it employs a complex personality with ideas and even fads
of its own.&nbsp; It depends on the loyal devotion of its
servants, and the devoted loyalty of trusted servants is
associated with a certain amount of affectionate contempt, which
keeps it sweet, as it were.&nbsp; By a benevolent provision of
Nature no man is a hero to his valet, or else the heroes would
have to brush their own clothes.&nbsp; Likewise no department
appears perfectly wise to the intimacy of its workers.&nbsp; A
department does not know so much as some of its servants.&nbsp;
Being a dispassionate organism, it can never be perfectly
informed.&nbsp; It would not be good for its efficiency to know
too much.&nbsp; Chief Inspector Heat got out of the train in a
state of thoughtfulness entirely untainted with disloyalty, but
not quite free of that jealous mistrust which so often springs on
the ground of perfect devotion, whether to women or to
institutions.</p>
<p>It was in this mental disposition, physically very empty, but
still nauseated by what he had seen, that he had come upon the
Professor.&nbsp; Under these conditions which make for
irascibility in a sound, normal man, this meeting was specially
unwelcome to Chief Inspector Heat.&nbsp; He had not been thinking
of the Professor; he had not been thinking of any individual
anarchist at all.&nbsp; The complexion of that case had somehow
forced upon him the general idea of the absurdity of things
human, which in the abstract is sufficiently annoying to an
unphilosophical temperament, and in concrete instances becomes
exasperating beyond endurance.&nbsp; At the beginning of his
career Chief Inspector Heat had been concerned with the more
energetic forms of thieving.&nbsp; He had gained his spurs in
that sphere, and naturally enough had kept for it, after his
promotion to another department, a feeling not very far removed
from affection.&nbsp; Thieving was not a sheer absurdity.&nbsp;
It was a form of human industry, perverse indeed, but still an
industry exercised in an industrious world; it was work
undertaken for the same reason as the work in potteries, in coal
mines, in fields, in tool-grinding shops.&nbsp; It was labour,
whose practical difference from the other forms of labour
consisted in the nature of its risk, which did not lie in
ankylosis, or lead poisoning, or fire-damp, or gritty dust, but
in what may be briefly defined in its own special phraseology as
&ldquo;Seven years hard.&rdquo;&nbsp; Chief Inspector Heat was,
of course, not insensible to the gravity of moral
differences.&nbsp; But neither were the thieves he had been
looking after.&nbsp; They submitted to the severe sanctions of a
morality familiar to Chief Inspector Heat with a certain
resignation.</p>
<p>They were his fellow-citizens gone wrong because of imperfect
education, Chief Inspector Heat believed; but allowing for that
difference, he could understand the mind of a burglar, because,
as a matter of fact, the mind and the instincts of a burglar are
of the same kind as the mind and the instincts of a police
officer.&nbsp; Both recognise the same conventions, and have a
working knowledge of each other&rsquo;s methods and of the
routine of their respective trades.&nbsp; They understand each
other, which is advantageous to both, and establishes a sort of
amenity in their relations.&nbsp; Products of the same machine,
one classed as useful and the other as noxious, they take the
machine for granted in different ways, but with a seriousness
essentially the same.&nbsp; The mind of Chief Inspector Heat was
inaccessible to ideas of revolt.&nbsp; But his thieves were not
rebels.&nbsp; His bodily vigour, his cool inflexible manner, his
courage and his fairness, had secured for him much respect and
some adulation in the sphere of his early successes.&nbsp; He had
felt himself revered and admired.&nbsp; And Chief Inspector Heat,
arrested within six paces of the anarchist nick-named the
Professor, gave a thought of regret to the world of
thieves&mdash;sane, without morbid ideals, working by routine,
respectful of constituted authorities, free from all taint of
hate and despair.</p>
<p>After paying this tribute to what is normal in the
constitution of society (for the idea of thieving appeared to his
instinct as normal as the idea of property), Chief Inspector Heat
felt very angry with himself for having stopped, for having
spoken, for having taken that way at all on the ground of it
being a short cut from the station to the headquarters.&nbsp; And
he spoke again in his big authoritative voice, which, being
moderated, had a threatening character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not wanted, I tell you,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>The anarchist did not stir.&nbsp; An inward laugh of derision
uncovered not only his teeth but his gums as well, shook him all
over, without the slightest sound.&nbsp; Chief Inspector Heat was
led to add, against his better judgment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&nbsp; When I want you I will know where to
find you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those were perfectly proper words, within the tradition and
suitable to his character of a police officer addressing one of
his special flock.&nbsp; But the reception they got departed from
tradition and propriety.&nbsp; It was outrageous.&nbsp; The
stunted, weakly figure before him spoke at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt the papers would give you an
obituary notice then.&nbsp; You know best what that would be
worth to you.&nbsp; I should think you can imagine easily the
sort of stuff that would be printed.&nbsp; But you may be exposed
to the unpleasantness of being buried together with me, though I
suppose your friends would make an effort to sort us out as much
as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all his healthy contempt for the spirit dictating such
speeches, the atrocious allusiveness of the words had its effect
on Chief Inspector Heat.&nbsp; He had too much insight, and too
much exact information as well, to dismiss them as rot.&nbsp; The
dusk of this narrow lane took on a sinister tint from the dark,
frail little figure, its back to the wall, and speaking with a
weak, self-confident voice.&nbsp; To the vigorous, tenacious
vitality of the Chief Inspector, the physical wretchedness of
that being, so obviously not fit to live, was ominous; for it
seemed to him that if he had the misfortune to be such a
miserable object he would not have cared how soon he died.&nbsp;
Life had such a strong hold upon him that a fresh wave of nausea
broke out in slight perspiration upon his brow.&nbsp; The murmur
of town life, the subdued rumble of wheels in the two invisible
streets to the right and left, came through the curve of the
sordid lane to his ears with a precious familiarity and an
appealing sweetness.&nbsp; He was human.&nbsp; But Chief
Inspector Heat was also a man, and he could not let such words
pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this is good to frighten children with,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very well said, without scorn, with an almost austere
quietness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;but
there&rsquo;s no time like the present, believe me.&nbsp; For a
man of real convictions this is a fine opportunity of
self-sacrifice.&nbsp; You may not find another so favourable, so
humane.&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t even a cat near us, and these
condemned old houses would make a good heap of bricks where you
stand.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never get me at so little cost to life
and property, which you are paid to protect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re speaking
to,&rdquo; said Chief Inspector Heat firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I
were to lay my hands on you now I would be no better than
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; The game!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be sure our side will win in the end.&nbsp; It
may yet be necessary to make people believe that some of you
ought to be shot at sight like mad dogs.&nbsp; Then that will be
the game.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll be damned if I know what yours
is.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe you know yourselves.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll never get anything by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meantime it&rsquo;s you who get something from
it&mdash;so far.&nbsp; And you get it easily, too.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t speak of your salary, but haven&rsquo;t you made your
name simply by not understanding what we are after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you after, then?&rdquo; asked Chief Inspector
Heat, with scornful haste, like a man in a hurry who perceives he
is wasting his time.</p>
<p>The perfect anarchist answered by a smile which did not part
his thin colourless lips; and the celebrated Chief Inspector felt
a sense of superiority which induced him to raise a warning
finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it up&mdash;whatever it is,&rdquo; he said in an
admonishing tone, but not so kindly as if he were condescending
to give good advice to a cracksman of repute.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give
it up.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find we are too many for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fixed smile on the Professor&rsquo;s lips wavered, as if
the mocking spirit within had lost its assurance.&nbsp; Chief
Inspector Heat went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe me eh?&nbsp; Well, you&rsquo;ve
only got to look about you.&nbsp; We are.&nbsp; And anyway,
you&rsquo;re not doing it well.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re always making
a mess of it.&nbsp; Why, if the thieves didn&rsquo;t know their
work better they would starve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hint of an invincible multitude behind that man&rsquo;s
back roused a sombre indignation in the breast of the
Professor.&nbsp; He smiled no longer his enigmatic and mocking
smile.&nbsp; The resisting power of numbers, the unattackable
stolidity of a great multitude, was the haunting fear of his
sinister loneliness.&nbsp; His lips trembled for some time before
he managed to say in a strangled voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am doing my work better than you&rsquo;re doing
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do now,&rdquo; interrupted Chief
Inspector Heat hurriedly; and the Professor laughed right out
this time.&nbsp; While still laughing he moved on; but he did not
laugh long.&nbsp; It was a sad-faced, miserable little man who
emerged from the narrow passage into the bustle of the broad
thoroughfare.&nbsp; He walked with the nerveless gait of a tramp
going on, still going on, indifferent to rain or sun in a
sinister detachment from the aspects of sky and earth.&nbsp;
Chief Inspector Heat, on the other hand, after watching him for a
while, stepped out with the purposeful briskness of a man
disregarding indeed the inclemencies of the weather, but
conscious of having an authorised mission on this earth and the
moral support of his kind.&nbsp; All the inhabitants of the
immense town, the population of the whole country, and even the
teeming millions struggling upon the planet, were with
him&mdash;down to the very thieves and mendicants.&nbsp; Yes, the
thieves themselves were sure to be with him in his present
work.&nbsp; The consciousness of universal support in his general
activity heartened him to grapple with the particular
problem.</p>
<p>The problem immediately before the Chief Inspector was that of
managing the Assistant Commissioner of his department, his
immediate superior.&nbsp; This is the perennial problem of trusty
and loyal servants; anarchism gave it its particular complexion,
but nothing more.&nbsp; Truth to say, Chief Inspector Heat
thought but little of anarchism.&nbsp; He did not attach undue
importance to it, and could never bring himself to consider it
seriously.&nbsp; It had more the character of disorderly conduct;
disorderly without the human excuse of drunkenness, which at any
rate implies good feeling and an amiable leaning towards
festivity.&nbsp; As criminals, anarchists were distinctly no
class&mdash;no class at all.&nbsp; And recalling the Professor,
Chief Inspector Heat, without checking his swinging pace,
muttered through his teeth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lunatic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catching thieves was another matter altogether.&nbsp; It had
that quality of seriousness belonging to every form of open sport
where the best man wins under perfectly comprehensible
rules.&nbsp; There were no rules for dealing with
anarchists.&nbsp; And that was distasteful to the Chief
Inspector.&nbsp; It was all foolishness, but that foolishness
excited the public mind, affected persons in high places, and
touched upon international relations.&nbsp; A hard, merciless
contempt settled rigidly on the Chief Inspector&rsquo;s face as
he walked on.&nbsp; His mind ran over all the anarchists of his
flock.&nbsp; Not one of them had half the spunk of this or that
burglar he had known.&nbsp; Not half&mdash;not one-tenth.</p>
<p>At headquarters the Chief Inspector was admitted at once to
the Assistant Commissioner&rsquo;s private room.&nbsp; He found
him, pen in hand, bent over a great table bestrewn with papers,
as if worshipping an enormous double inkstand of bronze and
crystal.&nbsp; Speaking tubes resembling snakes were tied by the
heads to the back of the Assistant Commissioner&rsquo;s wooden
arm-chair, and their gaping mouths seemed ready to bite his
elbows.&nbsp; And in this attitude he raised only his eyes, whose
lids were darker than his face and very much creased.&nbsp; The
reports had come in: every anarchist had been exactly accounted
for.</p>
<p>After saying this he lowered his eyes, signed rapidly two
single sheets of paper, and only then laid down his pen, and sat
well back, directing an inquiring gaze at his renowned
subordinate.&nbsp; The Chief Inspector stood it well, deferential
but inscrutable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay you were right,&rdquo; said the Assistant
Commissioner, &ldquo;in telling me at first that the London
anarchists had nothing to do with this.&nbsp; I quite appreciate
the excellent watch kept on them by your men.&nbsp; On the other
hand, this, for the public, does not amount to more than a
confession of ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner&rsquo;s delivery was leisurely, as
it were cautious.&nbsp; His thought seemed to rest poised on a
word before passing to another, as though words had been the
stepping-stones for his intellect picking its way across the
waters of error.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unless you have brought something
useful from Greenwich,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The Chief Inspector began at once the account of his
investigation in a clear matter-of-fact manner.&nbsp; His
superior turning his chair a little, and crossing his thin legs,
leaned sideways on his elbow, with one hand shading his
eyes.&nbsp; His listening attitude had a sort of angular and
sorrowful grace.&nbsp; Gleams as of highly burnished silver
played on the sides of his ebony black head when he inclined it
slowly at the end.</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Heat waited with the appearance of turning
over in his mind all he had just said, but, as a matter of fact,
considering the advisability of saying something more.&nbsp; The
Assistant Commissioner cut his hesitation short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe there were two men?&rdquo; he asked,
without uncovering his eyes.</p>
<p>The Chief Inspector thought it more than probable.&nbsp; In
his opinion, the two men had parted from each other within a
hundred yards from the Observatory walls.&nbsp; He explained also
how the other man could have got out of the park speedily without
being observed.&nbsp; The fog, though not very dense, was in his
favour.&nbsp; He seemed to have escorted the other to the spot,
and then to have left him there to do the job
single-handed.&nbsp; Taking the time those two were seen coming
out of Maze Hill Station by the old woman, and the time when the
explosion was heard, the Chief Inspector thought that the other
man might have been actually at the Greenwich Park Station, ready
to catch the next train up, at the moment his comrade was
destroying himself so thoroughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very thoroughly&mdash;eh?&rdquo; murmured the Assistant
Commissioner from under the shadow of his hand.</p>
<p>The Chief Inspector in a few vigorous words described the
aspect of the remains.&nbsp; &ldquo;The coroner&rsquo;s jury will
have a treat,&rdquo; he added grimly.</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner uncovered his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have nothing to tell them,&rdquo; he remarked
languidly.</p>
<p>He looked up, and for a time watched the markedly
non-committal attitude of his Chief Inspector.&nbsp; His nature
was one that is not easily accessible to illusions.&nbsp; He knew
that a department is at the mercy of its subordinate officers,
who have their own conceptions of loyalty.&nbsp; His career had
begun in a tropical colony.&nbsp; He had liked his work
there.&nbsp; It was police work.&nbsp; He had been very
successful in tracking and breaking up certain nefarious secret
societies amongst the natives.&nbsp; Then he took his long leave,
and got married rather impulsively.&nbsp; It was a good match
from a worldly point of view, but his wife formed an unfavourable
opinion of the colonial climate on hearsay evidence.&nbsp; On the
other hand, she had influential connections.&nbsp; It was an
excellent match.&nbsp; But he did not like the work he had to do
now.&nbsp; He felt himself dependent on too many subordinates and
too many masters.&nbsp; The near presence of that strange
emotional phenomenon called public opinion weighed upon his
spirits, and alarmed him by its irrational nature.&nbsp; No doubt
that from ignorance he exaggerated to himself its power for good
and evil&mdash;especially for evil; and the rough east winds of
the English spring (which agreed with his wife) augmented his
general mistrust of men&rsquo;s motives and of the efficiency of
their organisation.&nbsp; The futility of office work especially
appalled him on those days so trying to his sensitive liver.</p>
<p>He got up, unfolding himself to his full height, and with a
heaviness of step remarkable in so slender a man, moved across
the room to the window.&nbsp; The panes streamed with rain, and
the short street he looked down into lay wet and empty, as if
swept clear suddenly by a great flood.&nbsp; It was a very trying
day, choked in raw fog to begin with, and now drowned in cold
rain.&nbsp; The flickering, blurred flames of gas-lamps seemed to
be dissolving in a watery atmosphere.&nbsp; And the lofty
pretensions of a mankind oppressed by the miserable indignities
of the weather appeared as a colossal and hopeless vanity
deserving of scorn, wonder, and compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible, horrible!&rdquo; thought the Assistant
Commissioner to himself, with his face near the
window-pane.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have been having this sort of thing
now for ten days; no, a fortnight&mdash;a fortnight.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He ceased to think completely for a time.&nbsp; That utter
stillness of his brain lasted about three seconds.&nbsp; Then he
said perfunctorily: &ldquo;You have set inquiries on foot for
tracing that other man up and down the line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had no doubt that everything needful had been done.&nbsp;
Chief Inspector Heat knew, of course, thoroughly the business of
man-hunting.&nbsp; And these were the routine steps, too, that
would be taken as a matter of course by the merest
beginner.&nbsp; A few inquiries amongst the ticket collectors and
the porters of the two small railway stations would give
additional details as to the appearance of the two men; the
inspection of the collected tickets would show at once where they
came from that morning.&nbsp; It was elementary, and could not
have been neglected.&nbsp; Accordingly the Chief Inspector
answered that all this had been done directly the old woman had
come forward with her deposition.&nbsp; And he mentioned the name
of a station.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where they came from,
sir,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;The porter who took the
tickets at Maze Hill remembers two chaps answering to the
description passing the barrier.&nbsp; They seemed to him two
respectable working men of a superior sort&mdash;sign painters or
house decorators.&nbsp; The big man got out of a third-class
compartment backward, with a bright tin can in his hand.&nbsp; On
the platform he gave it to carry to the fair young fellow who
followed him.&nbsp; All this agrees exactly with what the old
woman told the police sergeant in Greenwich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner, still with his face turned to the
window, expressed his doubt as to these two men having had
anything to do with the outrage.&nbsp; All this theory rested
upon the utterances of an old charwoman who had been nearly
knocked down by a man in a hurry.&nbsp; Not a very substantial
authority indeed, unless on the ground of sudden inspiration,
which was hardly tenable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly now, could she have been really
inspired?&rdquo; he queried, with grave irony, keeping his back
to the room, as if entranced by the contemplation of the
town&rsquo;s colossal forms half lost in the night.&nbsp; He did
not even look round when he heard the mutter of the word
&ldquo;Providential&rdquo; from the principal subordinate of his
department, whose name, printed sometimes in the papers, was
familiar to the great public as that of one of its zealous and
hard-working protectors.&nbsp; Chief Inspector Heat raised his
voice a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strips and bits of bright tin were quite visible to
me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty good
corroboration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these men came from that little country
station,&rdquo; the Assistant Commissioner mused aloud,
wondering.&nbsp; He was told that such was the name on two
tickets out of three given up out of that train at Maze
Hill.&nbsp; The third person who got out was a hawker from
Gravesend well known to the porters.&nbsp; The Chief Inspector
imparted that information in a tone of finality with some ill
humour, as loyal servants will do in the consciousness of their
fidelity and with the sense of the value of their loyal
exertions.&nbsp; And still the Assistant Commissioner did not
turn away from the darkness outside, as vast as a sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two foreign anarchists coming from that place,&rdquo;
he said, apparently to the window-pane.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
rather unaccountable.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; But it would be still more
unaccountable if that Michaelis weren&rsquo;t staying in a
cottage in the neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of that name, falling unexpectedly into this
annoying affair, the Assistant Commissioner dismissed brusquely
the vague remembrance of his daily whist party at his club.&nbsp;
It was the most comforting habit of his life, in a mainly
successful display of his skill without the assistance of any
subordinate.&nbsp; He entered his club to play from five to
seven, before going home to dinner, forgetting for those two
hours whatever was distasteful in his life, as though the game
were a beneficent drug for allaying the pangs of moral
discontent.&nbsp; His partners were the gloomily humorous editor
of a celebrated magazine; a silent, elderly barrister with
malicious little eyes; and a highly martial, simple-minded old
Colonel with nervous brown hands.&nbsp; They were his club
acquaintances merely.&nbsp; He never met them elsewhere except at
the card-table.&nbsp; But they all seemed to approach the game in
the spirit of co-sufferers, as if it were indeed a drug against
the secret ills of existence; and every day as the sun declined
over the countless roofs of the town, a mellow, pleasurable
impatience, resembling the impulse of a sure and profound
friendship, lightened his professional labours.&nbsp; And now
this pleasurable sensation went out of him with something
resembling a physical shock, and was replaced by a special kind
of interest in his work of social protection&mdash;an improper
sort of interest, which may be defined best as a sudden and alert
mistrust of the weapon in his hand.</p>
