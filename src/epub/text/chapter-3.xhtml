<p>&ldquo; . . . All idealisation makes life poorer.&nbsp; To
beautify it is to take away its character of complexity&mdash;it
is to destroy it.&nbsp; Leave that to the moralists, my
boy.&nbsp; History is made by men, but they do not make it in
their heads.&nbsp; The ideas that are born in their consciousness
play an insignificant part in the march of events.&nbsp; History
is dominated and determined by the tool and the
production&mdash;by the force of economic conditions.&nbsp;
Capitalism has made socialism, and the laws made by the
capitalism for the protection of property are responsible for
anarchism.&nbsp; No one can tell what form the social
organisation may take in the future.&nbsp; Then why indulge in
prophetic phantasies?&nbsp; At best they can only interpret the
mind of the prophet, and can have no objective value.&nbsp; Leave
that pastime to the moralists, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michaelis, the ticket-of-leave apostle, was speaking in an
even voice, a voice that wheezed as if deadened and oppressed by
the layer of fat on his chest.&nbsp; He had come out of a highly
hygienic prison round like a tub, with an enormous stomach and
distended cheeks of a pale, semi-transparent complexion, as
though for fifteen years the servants of an outraged society had
made a point of stuffing him with fattening foods in a damp and
lightless cellar.&nbsp; And ever since he had never managed to
get his weight down as much as an ounce.</p>
<p>It was said that for three seasons running a very wealthy old
lady had sent him for a cure to Marienbad&mdash;where he was
about to share the public curiosity once with a crowned
head&mdash;but the police on that occasion ordered him to leave
within twelve hours.&nbsp; His martyrdom was continued by
forbidding him all access to the healing waters.&nbsp; But he was
resigned now.</p>
<p>With his elbow presenting no appearance of a joint, but more
like a bend in a dummy&rsquo;s limb, thrown over the back of a
chair, he leaned forward slightly over his short and enormous
thighs to spit into the grate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; I had the time to think things out a
little,&rdquo; he added without emphasis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Society
has given me plenty of time for meditation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other side of the fireplace, in the horse-hair
arm-chair where Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s mother was generally
privileged to sit, Karl Yundt giggled grimly, with a faint black
grimace of a toothless mouth.&nbsp; The terrorist, as he called
himself, was old and bald, with a narrow, snow-white wisp of a
goatee hanging limply from his chin.&nbsp; An extraordinary
expression of underhand malevolence survived in his extinguished
eyes.&nbsp; When he rose painfully the thrusting forward of a
skinny groping hand deformed by gouty swellings suggested the
effort of a moribund murderer summoning all his remaining
strength for a last stab.&nbsp; He leaned on a thick stick, which
trembled under his other hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always dreamed,&rdquo; he mouthed fiercely,
&ldquo;of a band of men absolute in their resolve to discard all
scruples in the choice of means, strong enough to give themselves
frankly the name of destroyers, and free from the taint of that
resigned pessimism which rots the world.&nbsp; No pity for
anything on earth, including themselves, and death enlisted for
good and all in the service of humanity&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I
would have liked to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His little bald head quivered, imparting a comical vibration
to the wisp of white goatee.&nbsp; His enunciation would have
been almost totally unintelligible to a stranger.&nbsp; His
worn-out passion, resembling in its impotent fierceness the
excitement of a senile sensualist, was badly served by a dried
throat and toothless gums which seemed to catch the tip of his
tongue.&nbsp; Mr Verloc, established in the corner of the sofa at
the other end of the room, emitted two hearty grunts of
assent.</p>
<p>The old terrorist turned slowly his head on his skinny neck
from side to side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I could never get as many as three such men
together.&nbsp; So much for your rotten pessimism,&rdquo; he
snarled at Michaelis, who uncrossed his thick legs, similar to
bolsters, and slid his feet abruptly under his chair in sign of
exasperation.</p>
<p>He a pessimist!&nbsp; Preposterous!&nbsp; He cried out that
the charge was outrageous.&nbsp; He was so far from pessimism
that he saw already the end of all private property coming along
logically, unavoidably, by the mere development of its inherent
viciousness.&nbsp; The possessors of property had not only to
face the awakened proletariat, but they had also to fight amongst
themselves.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Struggle, warfare, was the condition
of private ownership.&nbsp; It was fatal.&nbsp; Ah! he did not
depend upon emotional excitement to keep up his belief, no
declamations, no anger, no visions of blood-red flags waving, or
metaphorical lurid suns of vengeance rising above the horizon of
a doomed society.&nbsp; Not he!&nbsp; Cold reason, he boasted,
was the basis of his optimism.&nbsp; Yes, optimism&mdash;</p>
<p>His laborious wheezing stopped, then, after a gasp or two, he
added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that, if I had not been the
optimist I am, I could not have found in fifteen years some means
to cut my throat?&nbsp; And, in the last instance, there were
always the walls of my cell to dash my head against.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shortness of breath took all fire, all animation out of
his voice; his great, pale cheeks hung like filled pouches,
motionless, without a quiver; but in his blue eyes, narrowed as
if peering, there was the same look of confident shrewdness, a
little crazy in its fixity, they must have had while the
indomitable optimist sat thinking at night in his cell.&nbsp;
Before him, Karl Yundt remained standing, one wing of his faded
greenish havelock thrown back cavalierly over his shoulder.&nbsp;
Seated in front of the fireplace, Comrade Ossipon, ex-medical
student, the principal writer of the F. P. leaflets, stretched
out his robust legs, keeping the soles of his boots turned up to
the glow in the grate.&nbsp; A bush of crinkly yellow hair topped
his red, freckled face, with a flattened nose and prominent mouth
cast in the rough mould of the negro type.&nbsp; His
almond-shaped eyes leered languidly over the high
cheek-bones.&nbsp; He wore a grey flannel shirt, the loose ends
of a black silk tie hung down the buttoned breast of his serge
coat; and his head resting on the back of his chair, his throat
largely exposed, he raised to his lips a cigarette in a long
wooden tube, puffing jets of smoke straight up at the
ceiling.</p>
<p>Michaelis pursued his idea&mdash;<i>the</i> idea of his
solitary reclusion&mdash;the thought vouchsafed to his captivity
and growing like a faith revealed in visions.&nbsp; He talked to
himself, indifferent to the sympathy or hostility of his hearers,
indifferent indeed to their presence, from the habit he had
acquired of thinking aloud hopefully in the solitude of the four
whitewashed walls of his cell, in the sepulchral silence of the
great blind pile of bricks near a river, sinister and ugly like a
colossal mortuary for the socially drowned.</p>
<p>He was no good in discussion, not because any amount of
argument could shake his faith, but because the mere fact of
hearing another voice disconcerted him painfully, confusing his
thoughts at once&mdash;these thoughts that for so many years, in
a mental solitude more barren than a waterless desert, no living
voice had ever combatted, commented, or approved.</p>
<p>No one interrupted him now, and he made again the confession
of his faith, mastering him irresistible and complete like an act
of grace: the secret of fate discovered in the material side of
life; the economic condition of the world responsible for the
past and shaping the future; the source of all history, of all
ideas, guiding the mental development of mankind and the very
impulses of their passion&mdash;</p>
<p>A harsh laugh from Comrade Ossipon cut the tirade dead short
in a sudden faltering of the tongue and a bewildered unsteadiness
of the apostle&rsquo;s mildly exalted eyes.&nbsp; He closed them
slowly for a moment, as if to collect his routed thoughts.&nbsp;
A silence fell; but what with the two gas-jets over the table and
the glowing grate the little parlour behind Mr Verloc&rsquo;s
shop had become frightfully hot.&nbsp; Mr Verloc, getting off the
sofa with ponderous reluctance, opened the door leading into the
kitchen to get more air, and thus disclosed the innocent Stevie,
seated very good and quiet at a deal table, drawing circles,
circles, circles; innumerable circles, concentric, eccentric; a
coruscating whirl of circles that by their tangled multitude of
repeated curves, uniformity of form, and confusion of
intersecting lines suggested a rendering of cosmic chaos, the
symbolism of a mad art attempting the inconceivable.&nbsp; The
artist never turned his head; and in all his soul&rsquo;s
application to the task his back quivered, his thin neck, sunk
into a deep hollow at the base of the skull, seemed ready to
snap.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc, after a grunt of disapproving surprise, returned to
the sofa.&nbsp; Alexander Ossipon got up, tall in his threadbare
blue serge suit under the low ceiling, shook off the stiffness of
long immobility, and strolled away into the kitchen (down two
steps) to look over Stevie&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; He came back,
pronouncing oracularly: &ldquo;Very good.&nbsp; Very
characteristic, perfectly typical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s very good?&rdquo; grunted inquiringly Mr
Verloc, settled again in the corner of the sofa.&nbsp; The other
explained his meaning negligently, with a shade of condescension
and a toss of his head towards the kitchen:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Typical of this form of degeneracy&mdash;these
drawings, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would call that lad a degenerate, would you?&rdquo;
mumbled Mr Verloc.</p>
<p>Comrade Alexander Ossipon&mdash;nicknamed the Doctor,
ex-medical student without a degree; afterwards wandering
lecturer to working-men&rsquo;s associations upon the socialistic
aspects of hygiene; author of a popular quasi-medical study (in
the form of a cheap pamphlet seized promptly by the police)
entitled &ldquo;The Corroding Vices of the Middle Classes&rdquo;;
special delegate of the more or less mysterious Red Committee,
together with Karl Yundt and Michaelis for the work of literary
propaganda&mdash;turned upon the obscure familiar of at least two
Embassies that glance of insufferable, hopelessly dense
sufficiency which nothing but the frequentation of science can
give to the dulness of common mortals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he may be called
scientifically.&nbsp; Very good type too, altogether, of that
sort of degenerate.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s enough to glance at the
lobes of his ears.&nbsp; If you read Lombroso&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc, moody and spread largely on the sofa, continued to
look down the row of his waistcoat buttons; but his cheeks became
tinged by a faint blush.&nbsp; Of late even the merest derivative
of the word science (a term in itself inoffensive and of
indefinite meaning) had the curious power of evoking a definitely
offensive mental vision of Mr Vladimir, in his body as he lived,
with an almost supernatural clearness.&nbsp; And this phenomenon,
deserving justly to be classed amongst the marvels of science,
induced in Mr Verloc an emotional state of dread and exasperation
tending to express itself in violent swearing.&nbsp; But he said
nothing.&nbsp; It was Karl Yundt who was heard, implacable to his
last breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lombroso is an ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Comrade Ossipon met the shock of this blasphemy by an awful,
vacant stare.&nbsp; And the other, his extinguished eyes without
gleams blackening the deep shadows under the great, bony
forehead, mumbled, catching the tip of his tongue between his
lips at every second word as though he were chewing it
angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see such an idiot?&nbsp; For him the
criminal is the prisoner.&nbsp; Simple, is it not?&nbsp; What
about those who shut him up there&mdash;forced him in
there?&nbsp; Exactly.&nbsp; Forced him in there.&nbsp; And what
is crime?&nbsp; Does he know that, this imbecile who has made his
way in this world of gorged fools by looking at the ears and
teeth of a lot of poor, luckless devils?&nbsp; Teeth and ears
mark the criminal?&nbsp; Do they?&nbsp; And what about the law
that marks him still better&mdash;the pretty branding instrument
invented by the overfed to protect themselves against the
hungry?&nbsp; Red-hot applications on their vile
skins&mdash;hey?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you smell and hear from here
the thick hide of the people burn and sizzle?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
how criminals are made for your Lombrosos to write their silly
stuff about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knob of his stick and his legs shook together with
passion, whilst the trunk, draped in the wings of the havelock,
preserved his historic attitude of defiance.&nbsp; He seemed to
sniff the tainted air of social cruelty, to strain his ear for
its atrocious sounds.&nbsp; There was an extraordinary force of
suggestion in this posturing.&nbsp; The all but moribund veteran
of dynamite wars had been a great actor in his time&mdash;actor
on platforms, in secret assemblies, in private interviews.&nbsp;
The famous terrorist had never in his life raised personally as
much as his little finger against the social edifice.&nbsp; He
was no man of action; he was not even an orator of torrential
eloquence, sweeping the masses along in the rushing noise and
foam of a great enthusiasm.&nbsp; With a more subtle intention,
he took the part of an insolent and venomous evoker of sinister
impulses which lurk in the blind envy and exasperated vanity of
ignorance, in the suffering and misery of poverty, in all the
hopeful and noble illusions of righteous anger, pity, and
revolt.&nbsp; The shadow of his evil gift clung to him yet like
the smell of a deadly drug in an old vial of poison, emptied now,
useless, ready to be thrown away upon the rubbish-heap of things
that had served their time.</p>
<p>Michaelis, the ticket-of-leave apostle, smiled vaguely with
his glued lips; his pasty moon face drooped under the weight of
melancholy assent.&nbsp; He had been a prisoner himself.&nbsp;
His own skin had sizzled under the red-hot brand, he murmured
softly.&nbsp; But Comrade Ossipon, nicknamed the Doctor, had got
over the shock by that time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he began
disdainfully, but stopped short, intimidated by the dead
blackness of the cavernous eyes in the face turned slowly towards
him with a blind stare, as if guided only by the sound.&nbsp; He
gave the discussion up, with a slight shrug of the shoulders.</p>
<p>Stevie, accustomed to move about disregarded, had got up from
the kitchen table, carrying off his drawing to bed with
him.&nbsp; He had reached the parlour door in time to receive in
full the shock of Karl Yundt&rsquo;s eloquent imagery.&nbsp; The
sheet of paper covered with circles dropped out of his fingers,
and he remained staring at the old terrorist, as if rooted
suddenly to the spot by his morbid horror and dread of physical
pain.&nbsp; Stevie knew very well that hot iron applied to
one&rsquo;s skin hurt very much.&nbsp; His scared eyes blazed
with indignation: it would hurt terribly.&nbsp; His mouth dropped
open.</p>
<p>Michaelis by staring unwinkingly at the fire had regained that
sentiment of isolation necessary for the continuity of his
thought.&nbsp; His optimism had begun to flow from his
lips.&nbsp; He saw Capitalism doomed in its cradle, born with the
poison of the principle of competition in its system.&nbsp; The
great capitalists devouring the little capitalists, concentrating
the power and the tools of production in great masses, perfecting
industrial processes, and in the madness of self-aggrandisement
only preparing, organising, enriching, making ready the lawful
inheritance of the suffering proletariat.&nbsp; Michaelis
pronounced the great word &ldquo;Patience&rdquo;&mdash;and his
clear blue glance, raised to the low ceiling of Mr Verloc&rsquo;s
parlour, had a character of seraphic trustfulness.&nbsp; In the
doorway Stevie, calmed, seemed sunk in hebetude.</p>
<p>Comrade Ossipon&rsquo;s face twitched with exasperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s no use doing anything&mdash;no use
whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; protested Michaelis
gently.&nbsp; His vision of truth had grown so intense that the
sound of a strange voice failed to rout it this time.&nbsp; He
continued to look down at the red coals.&nbsp; Preparation for
the future was necessary, and he was willing to admit that the
great change would perhaps come in the upheaval of a
revolution.&nbsp; But he argued that revolutionary propaganda was
a delicate work of high conscience.&nbsp; It was the education of
the masters of the world.&nbsp; It should be as careful as the
education given to kings.&nbsp; He would have it advance its
tenets cautiously, even timidly, in our ignorance of the effect
that may be produced by any given economic change upon the
happiness, the morals, the intellect, the history of
mankind.&nbsp; For history is made with tools, not with ideas;
and everything is changed by economic conditions&mdash;art,
philosophy, love, virtue&mdash;truth itself!</p>
<p>The coals in the grate settled down with a slight crash; and
Michaelis, the hermit of visions in the desert of a penitentiary,
got up impetuously.&nbsp; Round like a distended balloon, he
opened his short, thick arms, as if in a pathetically hopeless
attempt to embrace and hug to his breast a self-regenerated
universe.&nbsp; He gasped with ardour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The future is as certain as the past&mdash;slavery,
feudalism, individualism, collectivism.&nbsp; This is the
statement of a law, not an empty prophecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disdainful pout of Comrade Ossipon&rsquo;s thick lips
accentuated the negro type of his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he said calmly enough.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is no law and no certainty.&nbsp; The teaching
propaganda be hanged.&nbsp; What the people knows does not
matter, were its knowledge ever so accurate.&nbsp; The only thing
that matters to us is the emotional state of the masses.&nbsp;
Without emotion there is no action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, then added with modest firmness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am speaking now to you
scientifically&mdash;scientifically&mdash;Eh?&nbsp; What did you
say, Verloc?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; growled from the sofa Mr Verloc, who,
provoked by the abhorrent sound, had merely muttered a
&ldquo;Damn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The venomous spluttering of the old terrorist without teeth
was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how I would call the nature of the present
economic conditions?&nbsp; I would call it cannibalistic.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what it is!&nbsp; They are nourishing their greed on
the quivering flesh and the warm blood of the
people&mdash;nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stevie swallowed the terrifying statement with an audible
gulp, and at once, as though it had been swift poison, sank
limply in a sitting posture on the steps of the kitchen door.</p>
<p>Michaelis gave no sign of having heard anything.&nbsp; His
lips seemed glued together for good; not a quiver passed over his
heavy cheeks.&nbsp; With troubled eyes he looked for his round,
hard hat, and put it on his round head.&nbsp; His round and obese
body seemed to float low between the chairs under the sharp elbow
of Karl Yundt.&nbsp; The old terrorist, raising an uncertain and
clawlike hand, gave a swaggering tilt to a black felt sombrero
shading the hollows and ridges of his wasted face.&nbsp; He got
in motion slowly, striking the floor with his stick at every
step.&nbsp; It was rather an affair to get him out of the house
because, now and then, he would stop, as if to think, and did not
offer to move again till impelled forward by Michaelis.&nbsp; The
gentle apostle grasped his arm with brotherly care; and behind
them, his hands in his pockets, the robust Ossipon yawned
vaguely.&nbsp; A blue cap with a patent leather peak set well at
the back of his yellow bush of hair gave him the aspect of a
Norwegian sailor bored with the world after a thundering
spree.&nbsp; Mr Verloc saw his guests off the premises, attending
them bareheaded, his heavy overcoat hanging open, his eyes on the
ground.</p>
<p>He closed the door behind their backs with restrained
violence, turned the key, shot the bolt.&nbsp; He was not
satisfied with his friends.&nbsp; In the light of Mr
Vladimir&rsquo;s philosophy of bomb throwing they appeared
hopelessly futile.&nbsp; The part of Mr Verloc in revolutionary
politics having been to observe, he could not all at once, either
in his own home or in larger assemblies, take the initiative of
action.&nbsp; He had to be cautious.&nbsp; Moved by the just
indignation of a man well over forty, menaced in what is dearest
to him&mdash;his repose and his security&mdash;he asked himself
scornfully what else could have been expected from such a lot,
this Karl Yundt, this Michaelis&mdash;this Ossipon.</p>
<p>Pausing in his intention to turn off the gas burning in the
middle of the shop, Mr Verloc descended into the abyss of moral
reflections.&nbsp; With the insight of a kindred temperament he
pronounced his verdict.&nbsp; A lazy lot&mdash;this Karl Yundt,
nursed by a blear-eyed old woman, a woman he had years ago
enticed away from a friend, and afterwards had tried more than
once to shake off into the gutter.&nbsp; Jolly lucky for Yundt
that she had persisted in coming up time after time, or else
there would have been no one now to help him out of the
&rsquo;bus by the Green Park railings, where that spectre took
its constitutional crawl every fine morning.&nbsp; When that
indomitable snarling old witch died the swaggering spectre would
have to vanish too&mdash;there would be an end to fiery Karl
Yundt.&nbsp; And Mr Verloc&rsquo;s morality was offended also by
the optimism of Michaelis, annexed by his wealthy old lady, who
had taken lately to sending him to a cottage she had in the
country.&nbsp; The ex-prisoner could moon about the shady lanes
for days together in a delicious and humanitarian idleness.&nbsp;
As to Ossipon, that beggar was sure to want for nothing as long
as there were silly girls with savings-bank books in the
world.&nbsp; And Mr Verloc, temperamentally identical with his
associates, drew fine distinctions in his mind on the strength of
insignificant differences.&nbsp; He drew them with a certain
complacency, because the instinct of conventional respectability
was strong within him, being only overcome by his dislike of all
kinds of recognised labour&mdash;a temperamental defect which he
shared with a large proportion of revolutionary reformers of a
given social state.&nbsp; For obviously one does not revolt
against the advantages and opportunities of that state, but
against the price which must be paid for the same in the coin of
accepted morality, self-restraint, and toil.&nbsp; The majority
of revolutionists are the enemies of discipline and fatigue
mostly.&nbsp; There are natures too, to whose sense of justice
the price exacted looms up monstrously enormous, odious,
oppressive, worrying, humiliating, extortionate,
intolerable.&nbsp; Those are the fanatics.&nbsp; The remaining
portion of social rebels is accounted for by vanity, the mother
of all noble and vile illusions, the companion of poets,
reformers, charlatans, prophets, and incendiaries.</p>
<p>Lost for a whole minute in the abyss of meditation, Mr Verloc
did not reach the depth of these abstract considerations.&nbsp;
Perhaps he was not able.&nbsp; In any case he had not the
time.&nbsp; He was pulled up painfully by the sudden recollection
of Mr Vladimir, another of his associates, whom in virtue of
subtle moral affinities he was capable of judging
correctly.&nbsp; He considered him as dangerous.&nbsp; A shade of
envy crept into his thoughts.&nbsp; Loafing was all very well for
these fellows, who knew not Mr Vladimir, and had women to fall
back upon; whereas he had a woman to provide for&mdash;</p>
<p>At this point, by a simple association of ideas, Mr Verloc was
brought face to face with the necessity of going to bed some time
or other that evening.&nbsp; Then why not go now&mdash;at
once?&nbsp; He sighed.&nbsp; The necessity was not so normally
pleasurable as it ought to have been for a man of his age and
temperament.&nbsp; He dreaded the demon of sleeplessness, which
he felt had marked him for its own.&nbsp; He raised his arm, and
turned off the flaring gas-jet above his head.</p>
<p>A bright band of light fell through the parlour door into the
part of the shop behind the counter.&nbsp; It enabled Mr Verloc
to ascertain at a glance the number of silver coins in the
till.&nbsp; These were but few; and for the first time since he
opened his shop he took a commercial survey of its value.&nbsp;
This survey was unfavourable.&nbsp; He had gone into trade for no
commercial reasons.&nbsp; He had been guided in the selection of
this peculiar line of business by an instinctive leaning towards
shady transactions, where money is picked up easily.&nbsp;
Moreover, it did not take him out of his own sphere&mdash;the
sphere which is watched by the police.&nbsp; On the contrary, it
gave him a publicly confessed standing in that sphere, and as Mr
Verloc had unconfessed relations which made him familiar with yet
careless of the police, there was a distinct advantage in such a
situation.&nbsp; But as a means of livelihood it was by itself
insufficient.</p>
<p>He took the cash-box out of the drawer, and turning to leave
the shop, became aware that Stevie was still downstairs.</p>
<p>What on earth is he doing there?&nbsp; Mr Verloc asked
himself.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the meaning of these antics?&nbsp; He
looked dubiously at his brother-in-law, but he did not ask him
for information.&nbsp; Mr Verloc&rsquo;s intercourse with Stevie
was limited to the casual mutter of a morning, after breakfast,
&ldquo;My boots,&rdquo; and even that was more a communication at
large of a need than a direct order or request.&nbsp; Mr Verloc
perceived with some surprise that he did not know really what to
say to Stevie.&nbsp; He stood still in the middle of the parlour,
and looked into the kitchen in silence.&nbsp; Nor yet did he know
what would happen if he did say anything.&nbsp; And this appeared
very queer to Mr Verloc in view of the fact, borne upon him
suddenly, that he had to provide for this fellow too.&nbsp; He
had never given a moment&rsquo;s thought till then to that aspect
of Stevie&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>Positively he did not know how to speak to the lad.&nbsp; He
watched him gesticulating and murmuring in the kitchen.&nbsp;
Stevie prowled round the table like an excited animal in a
cage.&nbsp; A tentative &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better go to bed
now?&rdquo; produced no effect whatever; and Mr Verloc,
abandoning the stony contemplation of his brother-in-law&rsquo;s
behaviour, crossed the parlour wearily, cash-box in hand.&nbsp;
The cause of the general lassitude he felt while climbing the
stairs being purely mental, he became alarmed by its inexplicable
character.&nbsp; He hoped he was not sickening for
anything.&nbsp; He stopped on the dark landing to examine his
sensations.&nbsp; But a slight and continuous sound of snoring
pervading the obscurity interfered with their clearness.&nbsp;
The sound came from his mother-in-law&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; Another
one to provide for, he thought&mdash;and on this thought walked
into the bedroom.</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc had fallen asleep with the lamp (no gas was laid
upstairs) turned up full on the table by the side of the
bed.&nbsp; The light thrown down by the shade fell dazzlingly on
the white pillow sunk by the weight of her head reposing with
closed eyes and dark hair done up in several plaits for the
night.&nbsp; She woke up with the sound of her name in her ears,
and saw her husband standing over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winnie!&nbsp; Winnie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first she did not stir, lying very quiet and looking at the
cash-box in Mr Verloc&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; But when she understood
that her brother was &ldquo;capering all over the place
downstairs&rdquo; she swung out in one sudden movement on to the
edge of the bed.&nbsp; Her bare feet, as if poked through the
bottom of an unadorned, sleeved calico sack buttoned tightly at
neck and wrists, felt over the rug for the slippers while she
looked upward into her husband&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to manage him,&rdquo; Mr Verloc
explained peevishly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do to leave him
downstairs alone with the lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said nothing, glided across the room swiftly, and the door
closed upon her white form.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc deposited the cash-box on the night table, and began
the operation of undressing by flinging his overcoat on to a
distant chair.&nbsp; His coat and waistcoat followed.&nbsp; He
walked about the room in his stockinged feet, and his burly
figure, with the hands worrying nervously at his throat, passed
and repassed across the long strip of looking-glass in the door
of his wife&rsquo;s wardrobe.&nbsp; Then after slipping his
braces off his shoulders he pulled up violently the venetian
blind, and leaned his forehead against the cold
window-pane&mdash;a fragile film of glass stretched between him
and the enormity of cold, black, wet, muddy, inhospitable
accumulation of bricks, slates, and stones, things in themselves
unlovely and unfriendly to man.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc felt the latent unfriendliness of all out of doors
with a force approaching to positive bodily anguish.&nbsp; There
is no occupation that fails a man more completely than that of a
secret agent of police.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like your horse suddenly
falling dead under you in the midst of an uninhabited and thirsty
plain.&nbsp; The comparison occurred to Mr Verloc because he had
sat astride various army horses in his time, and had now the
sensation of an incipient fall.&nbsp; The prospect was as black
as the window-pane against which he was leaning his
forehead.&nbsp; And suddenly the face of Mr Vladimir,
clean-shaved and witty, appeared enhaloed in the glow of its rosy
complexion like a sort of pink seal, impressed on the fatal
darkness.</p>
<p>This luminous and mutilated vision was so ghastly physically
that Mr Verloc started away from the window, letting down the
venetian blind with a great rattle.&nbsp; Discomposed and
speechless with the apprehension of more such visions, he beheld
his wife re-enter the room and get into bed in a calm
business-like manner which made him feel hopelessly lonely in the
world.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc expressed her surprise at seeing him up
yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel very well,&rdquo; he muttered,
passing his hands over his moist brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giddiness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Not at all well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc, with all the placidity of an experienced wife,
expressed a confident opinion as to the cause, and suggested the
usual remedies; but her husband, rooted in the middle of the
room, shook his lowered head sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch cold standing there,&rdquo; she
observed.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc made an effort, finished undressing, and got into
bed.&nbsp; Down below in the quiet, narrow street measured
footsteps approached the house, then died away unhurried and
firm, as if the passer-by had started to pace out all eternity,
from gas-lamp to gas-lamp in a night without end; and the drowsy
ticking of the old clock on the landing became distinctly audible
in the bedroom.</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc, on her back, and staring at the ceiling, made a
remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Takings very small to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc, in the same position, cleared his throat as if for
an important statement, but merely inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you turn off the gas downstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I did,&rdquo; answered Mrs Verloc
conscientiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;That poor boy is in a very excited
state to-night,&rdquo; she murmured, after a pause which lasted
for three ticks of the clock.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc cared nothing for Stevie&rsquo;s excitement, but he
felt horribly wakeful, and dreaded facing the darkness and
silence that would follow the extinguishing of the lamp.&nbsp;
This dread led him to make the remark that Stevie had disregarded
his suggestion to go to bed.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc, falling into the
trap, started to demonstrate at length to her husband that this
was not &ldquo;impudence&rdquo; of any sort, but simply
&ldquo;excitement.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was no young man of his age
in London more willing and docile than Stephen, she affirmed;
none more affectionate and ready to please, and even useful, as
long as people did not upset his poor head.&nbsp; Mrs Verloc,
turning towards her recumbent husband, raised herself on her
elbow, and hung over him in her anxiety that he should believe
Stevie to be a useful member of the family.&nbsp; That ardour of
protecting compassion exalted morbidly in her childhood by the
misery of another child tinged her sallow cheeks with a faint
dusky blush, made her big eyes gleam under the dark lids.&nbsp;
Mrs Verloc then looked younger; she looked as young as Winnie
used to look, and much more animated than the Winnie of the
Belgravian mansion days had ever allowed herself to appear to
gentlemen lodgers.&nbsp; Mr Verloc&rsquo;s anxieties had
prevented him from attaching any sense to what his wife was
saying.&nbsp; It was as if her voice were talking on the other
side of a very thick wall.&nbsp; It was her aspect that recalled
him to himself.</p>
<p>He appreciated this woman, and the sentiment of this
appreciation, stirred by a display of something resembling
emotion, only added another pang to his mental anguish.&nbsp;
When her voice ceased he moved uneasily, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been feeling well for the last few
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He might have meant this as an opening to a complete
confidence; but Mrs Verloc laid her head on the pillow again, and
staring upward, went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boy hears too much of what is talked about
here.&nbsp; If I had known they were coming to-night I would have
seen to it that he went to bed at the same time I did.&nbsp; He
was out of his mind with something he overheard about eating
people&rsquo;s flesh and drinking blood.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the
good of talking like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a note of indignant scorn in her voice.&nbsp; Mr
Verloc was fully responsive now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Karl Yundt,&rdquo; he growled savagely.</p>
<p>Mrs Verloc, with great decision, pronounced Karl Yundt
&ldquo;a disgusting old man.&rdquo;&nbsp; She declared openly her
affection for Michaelis.&nbsp; Of the robust Ossipon, in whose
presence she always felt uneasy behind an attitude of stony
reserve, she said nothing whatever.&nbsp; And continuing to talk
of that brother, who had been for so many years an object of care
and fears:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t fit to hear what&rsquo;s said
here.&nbsp; He believes it&rsquo;s all true.&nbsp; He knows no
better.&nbsp; He gets into his passions over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc made no comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He glared at me, as if he didn&rsquo;t know who I was,
when I went downstairs.&nbsp; His heart was going like a
hammer.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t help being excitable.&nbsp; I woke
mother up, and asked her to sit with him till he went to
sleep.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t his fault.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s no
trouble when he&rsquo;s left alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc made no comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he had never been to school,&rdquo; Mrs Verloc
began again brusquely.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always taking away
those newspapers from the window to read.&nbsp; He gets a red
face poring over them.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t get rid of a dozen
numbers in a month.&nbsp; They only take up room in the front
window.&nbsp; And Mr Ossipon brings every week a pile of these F.
P. tracts to sell at a halfpenny each.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t
give a halfpenny for the whole lot.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s silly
reading&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
sale for it.&nbsp; The other day Stevie got hold of one, and
there was a story in it of a German soldier officer tearing
half-off the ear of a recruit, and nothing was done to him for
it.&nbsp; The brute!&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t do anything with
Stevie that afternoon.&nbsp; The story was enough, too, to make
one&rsquo;s blood boil.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s the use of
printing things like that?&nbsp; We aren&rsquo;t German slaves
here, thank God.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not our business&mdash;is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to take the carving knife from the boy,&rdquo;
Mrs Verloc continued, a little sleepily now.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was
shouting and stamping and sobbing.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t stand the
notion of any cruelty.&nbsp; He would have stuck that officer
like a pig if he had seen him then.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true,
too!&nbsp; Some people don&rsquo;t deserve much
mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s voice ceased, and the
expression of her motionless eyes became more and more
contemplative and veiled during the long pause.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Comfortable, dear?&rdquo; she asked in a faint, far-away
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I put out the light now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dreary conviction that there was no sleep for him held Mr
Verloc mute and hopelessly inert in his fear of darkness.&nbsp;
He made a great effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Put it out,&rdquo; he said at last in a
hollow tone.</p>
