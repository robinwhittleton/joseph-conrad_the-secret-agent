<p>Most of the thirty or so little tables covered by red cloths
with a white design stood ranged at right angles to the deep
brown wainscoting of the underground hall.&nbsp; Bronze
chandeliers with many globes depended from the low, slightly
vaulted ceiling, and the fresco paintings ran flat and dull all
round the walls without windows, representing scenes of the chase
and of outdoor revelry in medi&aelig;val costumes.&nbsp; Varlets
in green jerkins brandished hunting knives and raised on high
tankards of foaming beer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I am very much mistaken, you are the man who
would know the inside of this confounded affair,&rdquo; said the
robust Ossipon, leaning over, his elbows far out on the table and
his feet tucked back completely under his chair.&nbsp; His eyes
stared with wild eagerness.</p>
<p>An upright semi-grand piano near the door, flanked by two
palms in pots, executed suddenly all by itself a valse tune with
aggressive virtuosity.&nbsp; The din it raised was
deafening.&nbsp; When it ceased, as abruptly as it had started,
the be-spectacled, dingy little man who faced Ossipon behind a
heavy glass mug full of beer emitted calmly what had the sound of
a general proposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In principle what one of us may or may not know as to
any given fact can&rsquo;t be a matter for inquiry to the
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Comrade Ossipon agreed in a quiet
undertone.&nbsp; &ldquo;In principle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his big florid face held between his hands he continued
to stare hard, while the dingy little man in spectacles coolly
took a drink of beer and stood the glass mug back on the
table.&nbsp; His flat, large ears departed widely from the sides
of his skull, which looked frail enough for Ossipon to crush
between thumb and forefinger; the dome of the forehead seemed to
rest on the rim of the spectacles; the flat cheeks, of a greasy,
unhealthy complexion, were merely smudged by the miserable
poverty of a thin dark whisker.&nbsp; The lamentable inferiority
of the whole physique was made ludicrous by the supremely
self-confident bearing of the individual.&nbsp; His speech was
curt, and he had a particularly impressive manner of keeping
silent.</p>
<p>Ossipon spoke again from between his hands in a mutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been out much to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I stayed in bed all the morning,&rdquo;
answered the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Nothing,&rdquo; said Ossipon, gazing
earnestly and quivering inwardly with the desire to find out
something, but obviously intimidated by the little man&rsquo;s
overwhelming air of unconcern.&nbsp; When talking with this
comrade&mdash;which happened but rarely&mdash;the big Ossipon
suffered from a sense of moral and even physical
insignificance.&nbsp; However, he ventured another
question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you walk down here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; omnibus,&rdquo; the little man answered readily
enough.&nbsp; He lived far away in Islington, in a small house
down a shabby street, littered with straw and dirty paper, where
out of school hours a troop of assorted children ran and
squabbled with a shrill, joyless, rowdy clamour.&nbsp; His single
back room, remarkable for having an extremely large cupboard, he
rented furnished from two elderly spinsters, dressmakers in a
humble way with a clientele of servant girls mostly.&nbsp; He had
a heavy padlock put on the cupboard, but otherwise he was a model
lodger, giving no trouble, and requiring practically no
attendance.&nbsp; His oddities were that he insisted on being
present when his room was being swept, and that when he went out
he locked his door, and took the key away with him.</p>
<p>Ossipon had a vision of these round black-rimmed spectacles
progressing along the streets on the top of an omnibus, their
self-confident glitter falling here and there on the walls of
houses or lowered upon the heads of the unconscious stream of
people on the pavements.&nbsp; The ghost of a sickly smile
altered the set of Ossipon&rsquo;s thick lips at the thought of
the walls nodding, of people running for life at the sight of
those spectacles.&nbsp; If they had only known!&nbsp; What a
panic!&nbsp; He murmured interrogatively: &ldquo;Been sitting
long here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An hour or more,&rdquo; answered the other negligently,
and took a pull at the dark beer.&nbsp; All his
movements&mdash;the way he grasped the mug, the act of drinking,
the way he set the heavy glass down and folded his arms&mdash;had
a firmness, an assured precision which made the big and muscular
Ossipon, leaning forward with staring eyes and protruding lips,
look the picture of eager indecision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An hour,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then it may be
you haven&rsquo;t heard yet the news I&rsquo;ve heard just
now&mdash;in the street.&nbsp; Have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man shook his head negatively the least bit.&nbsp;
But as he gave no indication of curiosity Ossipon ventured to add
that he had heard it just outside the place.&nbsp; A newspaper
boy had yelled the thing under his very nose, and not being
prepared for anything of that sort, he was very much startled and
upset.&nbsp; He had to come in there with a dry mouth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never thought of finding you here,&rdquo; he added,
murmuring steadily, with his elbows planted on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come here sometimes,&rdquo; said the other,
preserving his provoking coolness of demeanour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful that you of all people should have
heard nothing of it,&rdquo; the big Ossipon continued.&nbsp; His
eyelids snapped nervously upon the shining eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
of all people,&rdquo; he repeated tentatively.&nbsp; This obvious
restraint argued an incredible and inexplicable timidity of the
big fellow before the calm little man, who again lifted the glass
mug, drank, and put it down with brusque and assured
movements.&nbsp; And that was all.</p>
<p>Ossipon after waiting for something, word or sign, that did
not come, made an effort to assume a sort of indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you,&rdquo; he said, deadening his voice still more,
&ldquo;give your stuff to anybody who&rsquo;s up to asking you
for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My absolute rule is never to refuse anybody&mdash;as
long as I have a pinch by me,&rdquo; answered the little man with
decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a principle?&rdquo; commented Ossipon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a principle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think it&rsquo;s sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The large round spectacles, which gave a look of staring
self-confidence to the sallow face, confronted Ossipon like
sleepless, unwinking orbs flashing a cold fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; Under every
circumstance.&nbsp; What could stop me?&nbsp; Why should I
not?&nbsp; Why should I think twice about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ossipon gasped, as it were, discreetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you would hand it over to a
&lsquo;teck&rsquo; if one came to ask you for your
wares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them come and try it on, and you will see,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;They know me, but I know also every one of
them.&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t come near me&mdash;not
they.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thin livid lips snapped together firmly.&nbsp; Ossipon
began to argue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they could send someone&mdash;rig a plant on
you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see?&nbsp; Get the stuff from you in
that way, and then arrest you with the proof in their
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proof of what?&nbsp; Dealing in explosives without a
licence perhaps.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was meant for a contemptuous
jeer, though the expression of the thin, sickly face remained
unchanged, and the utterance was negligent.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s one of them anxious to make that
arrest.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think they could get one of them to
apply for a warrant.&nbsp; I mean one of the best.&nbsp; Not
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Ossipon asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they know very well I take care never to part
with the last handful of my wares.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve it always by
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He touched the breast of his coat lightly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In a thick glass flask,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have been told,&rdquo; said Ossipon, with a shade
of wonder in his voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t know
if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know,&rdquo; interrupted the little man crisply,
leaning against the straight chair back, which rose higher than
his fragile head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall never be arrested.&nbsp;
The game isn&rsquo;t good enough for any policeman of them
all.&nbsp; To deal with a man like me you require sheer, naked,
inglorious heroism.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again his lips closed with a
self-confident snap.&nbsp; Ossipon repressed a movement of
impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or recklessness&mdash;or simply ignorance,&rdquo; he
retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve only to get somebody for the
job who does not know you carry enough stuff in your pocket to
blow yourself and everything within sixty yards of you to
pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never affirmed I could not be eliminated,&rdquo;
rejoined the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;But that wouldn&rsquo;t be an
arrest.&nbsp; Moreover, it&rsquo;s not so easy as it
looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; Ossipon contradicted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to
prevent half-a-dozen of them jumping upon you from behind in the
street?&nbsp; With your arms pinned to your sides you could do
nothing&mdash;could you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I could.&nbsp; I am seldom out in the streets
after dark,&rdquo; said the little man impassively, &ldquo;and
never very late.&nbsp; I walk always with my right hand closed
round the india-rubber ball which I have in my trouser
pocket.&nbsp; The pressing of this ball actuates a detonator
inside the flask I carry in my pocket.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the
principle of the pneumatic instantaneous shutter for a camera
lens.&nbsp; The tube leads up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a swift disclosing gesture he gave Ossipon a glimpse of
an india-rubber tube, resembling a slender brown worm, issuing
from the armhole of his waistcoat and plunging into the inner
breast pocket of his jacket.&nbsp; His clothes, of a nondescript
brown mixture, were threadbare and marked with stains, dusty in
the folds, with ragged button-holes.&nbsp; &ldquo;The detonator
is partly mechanical, partly chemical,&rdquo; he explained, with
casual condescension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is instantaneous, of course?&rdquo; murmured
Ossipon, with a slight shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far from it,&rdquo; confessed the other, with a
reluctance which seemed to twist his mouth dolorously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A full twenty seconds must elapse from the moment I press
the ball till the explosion takes place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; whistled Ossipon, completely
appalled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Twenty seconds!&nbsp; Horrors!&nbsp; You
mean to say that you could face that?&nbsp; I should go
crazy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t matter if you did.&nbsp; Of course,
it&rsquo;s the weak point of this special system, which is only
for my own use.&nbsp; The worst is that the manner of exploding
is always the weak point with us.&nbsp; I am trying to invent a
detonator that would adjust itself to all conditions of action,
and even to unexpected changes of conditions.&nbsp; A variable
and yet perfectly precise mechanism.&nbsp; A really intelligent
detonator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty seconds,&rdquo; muttered Ossipon again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ough!&nbsp; And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a slight turn of the head the glitter of the spectacles
seemed to gauge the size of the beer saloon in the basement of
the renowned Silenus Restaurant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody in this room could hope to escape,&rdquo; was
the verdict of that survey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nor yet this couple
going up the stairs now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The piano at the foot of the staircase clanged through a
mazurka with brazen impetuosity, as though a vulgar and impudent
ghost were showing off.&nbsp; The keys sank and rose
mysteriously.&nbsp; Then all became still.&nbsp; For a moment
Ossipon imagined the overlighted place changed into a dreadful
black hole belching horrible fumes choked with ghastly rubbish of
smashed brickwork and mutilated corpses.&nbsp; He had such a
distinct perception of ruin and death that he shuddered
again.&nbsp; The other observed, with an air of calm
sufficiency:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the last instance it is character alone that makes
for one&rsquo;s safety.&nbsp; There are very few people in the
world whose character is as well established as mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how you managed it,&rdquo; growled
Ossipon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Force of personality,&rdquo; said the other, without
raising his voice; and coming from the mouth of that obviously
miserable organism the assertion caused the robust Ossipon to
bite his lower lip.&nbsp; &ldquo;Force of personality,&rdquo; he
repeated, with ostentatious calm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have the means
to make myself deadly, but that by itself, you understand, is
absolutely nothing in the way of protection.&nbsp; What is
effective is the belief those people have in my will to use the
means.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s their impression.&nbsp; It is
absolute.&nbsp; Therefore I am deadly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are individuals of character amongst that lot
too,&rdquo; muttered Ossipon ominously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly.&nbsp; But it is a matter of degree obviously,
since, for instance, I am not impressed by them.&nbsp; Therefore
they are inferior.&nbsp; They cannot be otherwise.&nbsp; Their
character is built upon conventional morality.&nbsp; It leans on
the social order.&nbsp; Mine stands free from everything
artificial.&nbsp; They are bound in all sorts of
conventions.&nbsp; They depend on life, which, in this
connection, is a historical fact surrounded by all sorts of
restraints and considerations, a complex organised fact open to
attack at every point; whereas I depend on death, which knows no
restraint and cannot be attacked.&nbsp; My superiority is
evident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a transcendental way of putting it,&rdquo; said
Ossipon, watching the cold glitter of the round spectacles.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard Karl Yundt say much the same thing not
very long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Karl Yundt,&rdquo; mumbled the other contemptuously,
&ldquo;the delegate of the International Red Committee, has been
a posturing shadow all his life.&nbsp; There are three of you
delegates, aren&rsquo;t there?&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t define the
other two, as you are one of them.&nbsp; But what you say means
nothing.&nbsp; You are the worthy delegates for revolutionary
propaganda, but the trouble is not only that you are as unable to
think independently as any respectable grocer or journalist of
them all, but that you have no character whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ossipon could not restrain a start of indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you want from us?&rdquo; he exclaimed in a
deadened voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it you are after
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A perfect detonator,&rdquo; was the peremptory
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you making that face for?&nbsp; You
see, you can&rsquo;t even bear the mention of something
conclusive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not making a face,&rdquo; growled the annoyed
Ossipon bearishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You revolutionists,&rdquo; the other continued, with
leisurely self-confidence, &ldquo;are the slaves of the social
convention, which is afraid of you; slaves of it as much as the
very police that stands up in the defence of that
convention.&nbsp; Clearly you are, since you want to
revolutionise it.&nbsp; It governs your thought, of course, and
your action too, and thus neither your thought nor your action
can ever be conclusive.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused, tranquil, with
that air of close, endless silence, then almost immediately went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not a bit better than the forces arrayed
against you&mdash;than the police, for instance.&nbsp; The other
day I came suddenly upon Chief Inspector Heat at the corner of
Tottenham Court Road.&nbsp; He looked at me very steadily.&nbsp;
But I did not look at him.&nbsp; Why should I give him more than
a glance?&nbsp; He was thinking of many things&mdash;of his
superiors, of his reputation, of the law courts, of his salary,
of newspapers&mdash;of a hundred things.&nbsp; But I was thinking
of my perfect detonator only.&nbsp; He meant nothing to me.&nbsp;
He was as insignificant as&mdash;I can&rsquo;t call to mind
anything insignificant enough to compare him with&mdash;except
Karl Yundt perhaps.&nbsp; Like to like.&nbsp; The terrorist and
the policeman both come from the same basket.&nbsp; Revolution,
legality&mdash;counter moves in the same game; forms of idleness
at bottom identical.&nbsp; He plays his little game&mdash;so do
you propagandists.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t play; I work fourteen
hours a day, and go hungry sometimes.&nbsp; My experiments cost
money now and again, and then I must do without food for a day or
two.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re looking at my beer.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I
have had two glasses already, and shall have another
presently.&nbsp; This is a little holiday, and I celebrate it
alone.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve the grit to work alone,
quite alone, absolutely alone.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve worked alone for
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ossipon&rsquo;s face had turned dusky red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the perfect detonator&mdash;eh?&rdquo; he sneered,
very low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; retorted the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a
good definition.&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t find anything half so
precise to define the nature of your activity with all your
committees and delegations.&nbsp; It is I who am the true
propagandist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t discuss that point,&rdquo; said Ossipon,
with an air of rising above personal considerations.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am afraid I&rsquo;ll have to spoil your holiday for you,
though.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a man blown up in Greenwich Park this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been yelling the news in the streets since
two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I bought the paper, and just ran in
here.&nbsp; Then I saw you sitting at this table.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got it in my pocket now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled the newspaper out.&nbsp; It was a good-sized rosy
sheet, as if flushed by the warmth of its own convictions, which
were optimistic.&nbsp; He scanned the pages rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Here it is.&nbsp; Bomb in Greenwich
Park.&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t much so far.&nbsp; Half-past
eleven.&nbsp; Foggy morning.&nbsp; Effects of explosion felt as
far as Romney Road and Park Place.&nbsp; Enormous hole in the
ground under a tree filled with smashed roots and broken
branches.&nbsp; All round fragments of a man&rsquo;s body blown
to pieces.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; The rest&rsquo;s mere
newspaper gup.&nbsp; No doubt a wicked attempt to blow up the
Observatory, they say.&nbsp; H&rsquo;m.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s hardly
credible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the paper for a while longer in silence, then
passed it to the other, who after gazing abstractedly at the
print laid it down without comment.</p>
<p>It was Ossipon who spoke first&mdash;still resentful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fragments of only <i>one</i> man, you note.&nbsp;
Ergo: blew <i>himself</i> up.&nbsp; That spoils your day off for
you&mdash;don&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Were you expecting that sort of
move?&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest idea&mdash;not the ghost
of a notion of anything of the sort being planned to come off
here&mdash;in this country.&nbsp; Under the present circumstances
it&rsquo;s nothing short of criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man lifted his thin black eyebrows with
dispassionate scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Criminal!&nbsp; What is that?&nbsp; What <i>is</i>
crime?&nbsp; What can be the meaning of such an
assertion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I to express myself?&nbsp; One must use the
current words,&rdquo; said Ossipon impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
meaning of this assertion is that this business may affect our
position very adversely in this country.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that
crime enough for you?&nbsp; I am convinced you have been giving
away some of your stuff lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ossipon stared hard.&nbsp; The other, without flinching,
lowered and raised his head slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have!&rdquo; burst out the editor of the F. P.
leaflets in an intense whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&nbsp; And are
you really handing it over at large like this, for the asking, to
the first fool that comes along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so!&nbsp; The condemned social order has not been
built up on paper and ink, and I don&rsquo;t fancy that a
combination of paper and ink will ever put an end to it, whatever
you may think.&nbsp; Yes, I would give the stuff with both hands
to every man, woman, or fool that likes to come along.&nbsp; I
know what you are thinking about.&nbsp; But I am not taking my
cue from the Red Committee.&nbsp; I would see you all hounded out
of here, or arrested&mdash;or beheaded for that
matter&mdash;without turning a hair.&nbsp; What happens to us as
individuals is not of the least consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke carelessly, without heat, almost without feeling, and
Ossipon, secretly much affected, tried to copy this
detachment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the police here knew their business they would shoot
you full of holes with revolvers, or else try to sand-bag you
from behind in broad daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man seemed already to have considered that point of
view in his dispassionate self-confident manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he assented with the utmost
readiness.&nbsp; &ldquo;But for that they would have to face
their own institutions.&nbsp; Do you see?&nbsp; That requires
uncommon grit.&nbsp; Grit of a special kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ossipon blinked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy that&rsquo;s exactly what would happen to you
if you were to set up your laboratory in the States.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t stand on ceremony with their institutions
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not likely to go and see.&nbsp; Otherwise your
remark is just,&rdquo; admitted the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have
more character over there, and their character is essentially
anarchistic.&nbsp; Fertile ground for us, the States&mdash;very
good ground.&nbsp; The great Republic has the root of the
destructive matter in her.&nbsp; The collective temperament is
lawless.&nbsp; Excellent.&nbsp; They may shoot us down,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too transcendental for me,&rdquo; growled
Ossipon, with moody concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Logical,&rdquo; protested the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
are several kinds of logic.&nbsp; This is the enlightened
kind.&nbsp; America is all right.&nbsp; It is this country that
is dangerous, with her idealistic conception of legality.&nbsp;
The social spirit of this people is wrapped up in scrupulous
prejudices, and that is fatal to our work.&nbsp; You talk of
England being our only refuge!&nbsp; So much the worse.&nbsp;
Capua!&nbsp; What do we want with refuges?&nbsp; Here you talk,
print, plot, and do nothing.&nbsp; I daresay it&rsquo;s very
convenient for such Karl Yundts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders slightly, then added with the same
leisurely assurance: &ldquo;To break up the superstition and
worship of legality should be our aim.&nbsp; Nothing would please
me more than to see Inspector Heat and his likes take to shooting
us down in broad daylight with the approval of the public.&nbsp;
Half our battle would be won then; the disintegration of the old
morality would have set in in its very temple.&nbsp; That is what
you ought to aim at.&nbsp; But you revolutionists will never
understand that.&nbsp; You plan the future, you lose yourselves
in reveries of economical systems derived from what is; whereas
what&rsquo;s wanted is a clean sweep and a clear start for a new
conception of life.&nbsp; That sort of future will take care of
itself if you will only make room for it.&nbsp; Therefore I would
shovel my stuff in heaps at the corners of the streets if I had
enough for that; and as I haven&rsquo;t, I do my best by
perfecting a really dependable detonator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ossipon, who had been mentally swimming in deep waters, seized
upon the last word as if it were a saving plank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Your detonators.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if it weren&rsquo;t one of your detonators that made a
clean sweep of the man in the park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shade of vexation darkened the determined sallow face
confronting Ossipon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My difficulty consists precisely in experimenting
practically with the various kinds.&nbsp; They must be tried
after all.&nbsp; Besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ossipon interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could that fellow be?&nbsp; I assure you that we in
London had no knowledge&mdash;Couldn&rsquo;t you describe the
person you gave the stuff to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other turned his spectacles upon Ossipon like a pair of
searchlights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Describe him,&rdquo; he repeated slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think there can be the slightest objection now.&nbsp;
I will describe him to you in one word&mdash;Verloc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ossipon, whom curiosity had lifted a few inches off his seat,
dropped back, as if hit in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verloc!&nbsp; Impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The self-possessed little man nodded slightly once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the person.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
say that in this case I was giving my stuff to the first fool
that came along.&nbsp; He was a prominent member of the group as
far as I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ossipon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Prominent.&nbsp;
No, not exactly.&nbsp; He was the centre for general
intelligence, and usually received comrades coming over
here.&nbsp; More useful than important.&nbsp; Man of no
ideas.&nbsp; Years ago he used to speak at meetings&mdash;in
France, I believe.&nbsp; Not very well, though.&nbsp; He was
trusted by such men as Latorre, Moser and all that old lot.&nbsp;
The only talent he showed really was his ability to elude the
attentions of the police somehow.&nbsp; Here, for instance, he
did not seem to be looked after very closely.&nbsp; He was
regularly married, you know.&nbsp; I suppose it&rsquo;s with her
money that he started that shop.&nbsp; Seemed to make it pay,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ossipon paused abruptly, muttered to himself &ldquo;I wonder
what that woman will do now?&rdquo; and fell into thought.</p>
<p>The other waited with ostentatious indifference.&nbsp; His
parentage was obscure, and he was generally known only by his
nickname of Professor.&nbsp; His title to that designation
consisted in his having been once assistant demonstrator in
chemistry at some technical institute.&nbsp; He quarrelled with
the authorities upon a question of unfair treatment.&nbsp;
Afterwards he obtained a post in the laboratory of a manufactory
of dyes.&nbsp; There too he had been treated with revolting
injustice.&nbsp; His struggles, his privations, his hard work to
raise himself in the social scale, had filled him with such an
exalted conviction of his merits that it was extremely difficult
for the world to treat him with justice&mdash;the standard of
that notion depending so much upon the patience of the
individual.&nbsp; The Professor had genius, but lacked the great
social virtue of resignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intellectually a nonentity,&rdquo; Ossipon pronounced
aloud, abandoning suddenly the inward contemplation of Mrs
Verloc&rsquo;s bereaved person and business.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quite
an ordinary personality.&nbsp; You are wrong in not keeping more
in touch with the comrades, Professor,&rdquo; he added in a
reproving tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did he say anything to
you&mdash;give you some idea of his intentions?&nbsp; I
hadn&rsquo;t seen him for a month.&nbsp; It seems impossible that
he should be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me it was going to be a demonstration against a
building,&rdquo; said the Professor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had to know
that much to prepare the missile.&nbsp; I pointed out to him that
I had hardly a sufficient quantity for a completely destructive
result, but he pressed me very earnestly to do my best.&nbsp; As
he wanted something that could be carried openly in the hand, I
proposed to make use of an old one-gallon copal varnish can I
happened to have by me.&nbsp; He was pleased at the idea.&nbsp;
It gave me some trouble, because I had to cut out the bottom
first and solder it on again afterwards.&nbsp; When prepared for
use, the can enclosed a wide-mouthed, well-corked jar of thick
glass packed around with some wet clay and containing sixteen
ounces of X2 green powder.&nbsp; The detonator was connected with
the screw top of the can.&nbsp; It was ingenious&mdash;a
combination of time and shock.&nbsp; I explained the system to
him.&nbsp; It was a thin tube of tin enclosing
a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ossipon&rsquo;s attention had wandered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think has happened?&rdquo; he
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; Screwed the top on tight, which
would make the connection, and then forgot the time.&nbsp; It was
set for twenty minutes.&nbsp; On the other hand, the time contact
being made, a sharp shock would bring about the explosion at
once.&nbsp; He either ran the time too close, or simply let the
thing fall.&nbsp; The contact was made all
right&mdash;that&rsquo;s clear to me at any rate.&nbsp; The
system&rsquo;s worked perfectly.&nbsp; And yet you would think
that a common fool in a hurry would be much more likely to forget
to make the contact altogether.&nbsp; I was worrying myself about
that sort of failure mostly.&nbsp; But there are more kinds of
fools than one can guard against.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t expect a
detonator to be absolutely fool-proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He beckoned to a waiter.&nbsp; Ossipon sat rigid, with the
abstracted gaze of mental travail.&nbsp; After the man had gone
away with the money he roused himself, with an air of profound
dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely unpleasant for me,&rdquo; he
mused.&nbsp; &ldquo;Karl has been in bed with bronchitis for a
week.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s an even chance that he will never get
up again.&nbsp; Michaelis&rsquo;s luxuriating in the country
somewhere.&nbsp; A fashionable publisher has offered him five
hundred pounds for a book.&nbsp; It will be a ghastly
failure.&nbsp; He has lost the habit of consecutive thinking in
prison, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor on his feet, now buttoning his coat, looked
about him with perfect indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Ossipon
wearily.&nbsp; He dreaded the blame of the Central Red Committee,
a body which had no permanent place of abode, and of whose
membership he was not exactly informed.&nbsp; If this affair
eventuated in the stoppage of the modest subsidy allotted to the
publication of the F. P. pamphlets, then indeed he would have to
regret Verloc&rsquo;s inexplicable folly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Solidarity with the extremest form of action is one
thing, and silly recklessness is another,&rdquo; he said, with a
sort of moody brutality.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
came to Verloc.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s some mystery there.&nbsp;
However, he&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp; You may take it as you like, but
under the circumstances the only policy for the militant
revolutionary group is to disclaim all connection with this
damned freak of yours.&nbsp; How to make the disclaimer
convincing enough is what bothers me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man on his feet, buttoned up and ready to go, was
no taller than the seated Ossipon.&nbsp; He levelled his
spectacles at the latter&rsquo;s face point-blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might ask the police for a testimonial of good
conduct.&nbsp; They know where every one of you slept last
night.&nbsp; Perhaps if you asked them they would consent to
publish some sort of official statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt they are aware well enough that we had nothing
to do with this,&rdquo; mumbled Ossipon bitterly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What they will say is another thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
remained thoughtful, disregarding the short, owlish, shabby
figure standing by his side.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must lay hands on
Michaelis at once, and get him to speak from his heart at one of
our gatherings.&nbsp; The public has a sort of sentimental regard
for that fellow.&nbsp; His name is known.&nbsp; And I am in touch
with a few reporters on the big dailies.&nbsp; What he would say
would be utter bosh, but he has a turn of talk that makes it go
down all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like treacle,&rdquo; interjected the Professor, rather
low, keeping an impassive expression.</p>
<p>The perplexed Ossipon went on communing with himself half
audibly, after the manner of a man reflecting in perfect
solitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confounded ass!&nbsp; To leave such an imbecile
business on my hands.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t even know
if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat with compressed lips.&nbsp; The idea of going for news
straight to the shop lacked charm.&nbsp; His notion was that
Verloc&rsquo;s shop might have been turned already into a police
trap.&nbsp; They will be bound to make some arrests, he thought,
with something resembling virtuous indignation, for the even
tenor of his revolutionary life was menaced by no fault of
his.&nbsp; And yet unless he went there he ran the risk of
remaining in ignorance of what perhaps it would be very material
for him to know.&nbsp; Then he reflected that, if the man in the
park had been so very much blown to pieces as the evening papers
said, he could not have been identified.&nbsp; And if so, the
police could have no special reason for watching Verloc&rsquo;s
shop more closely than any other place known to be frequented by
marked anarchists&mdash;no more reason, in fact, than for
watching the doors of the Silenus.&nbsp; There would be a lot of
watching all round, no matter where he went.&nbsp;
Still&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what I had better do now?&rdquo; he muttered,
taking counsel with himself.</p>
<p>A rasping voice at his elbow said, with sedate scorn:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fasten yourself upon the woman for all she&rsquo;s
worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After uttering these words the Professor walked away from the
table.&nbsp; Ossipon, whom that piece of insight had taken
unawares, gave one ineffectual start, and remained still, with a
helpless gaze, as though nailed fast to the seat of his
chair.&nbsp; The lonely piano, without as much as a music stool
to help it, struck a few chords courageously, and beginning a
selection of national airs, played him out at last to the tune of
&ldquo;Blue Bells of Scotland.&rdquo;&nbsp; The painfully
detached notes grew faint behind his back while he went slowly
upstairs, across the hall, and into the street.</p>
<p>In front of the great doorway a dismal row of newspaper
sellers standing clear of the pavement dealt out their wares from
the gutter.&nbsp; It was a raw, gloomy day of the early spring;
and the grimy sky, the mud of the streets, the rags of the dirty
men, harmonised excellently with the eruption of the damp,
rubbishy sheets of paper soiled with printers&rsquo; ink.&nbsp;
The posters, maculated with filth, garnished like tapestry the
sweep of the curbstone.&nbsp; The trade in afternoon papers was
brisk, yet, in comparison with the swift, constant march of foot
traffic, the effect was of indifference, of a disregarded
distribution.&nbsp; Ossipon looked hurriedly both ways before
stepping out into the cross-currents, but the Professor was
already out of sight.</p>
