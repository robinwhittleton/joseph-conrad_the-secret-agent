<p>Such was the house, the household, and the business Mr Verloc
left behind him on his way westward at the hour of half-past ten
in the morning.&nbsp; It was unusually early for him; his whole
person exhaled the charm of almost dewy freshness; he wore his
blue cloth overcoat unbuttoned; his boots were shiny; his cheeks,
freshly shaven, had a sort of gloss; and even his heavy-lidded
eyes, refreshed by a night of peaceful slumber, sent out glances
of comparative alertness.&nbsp; Through the park railings these
glances beheld men and women riding in the Row, couples cantering
past harmoniously, others advancing sedately at a walk, loitering
groups of three or four, solitary horsemen looking unsociable,
and solitary women followed at a long distance by a groom with a
cockade to his hat and a leather belt over his tight-fitting
coat.&nbsp; Carriages went bowling by, mostly two-horse
broughams, with here and there a victoria with the skin of some
wild beast inside and a woman&rsquo;s face and hat emerging above
the folded hood.&nbsp; And a peculiarly London sun&mdash;against
which nothing could be said except that it looked
bloodshot&mdash;glorified all this by its stare.&nbsp; It hung at
a moderate elevation above Hyde Park Corner with an air of
punctual and benign vigilance.&nbsp; The very pavement under Mr
Verloc&rsquo;s feet had an old-gold tinge in that diffused light,
in which neither wall, nor tree, nor beast, nor man cast a
shadow.&nbsp; Mr Verloc was going westward through a town without
shadows in an atmosphere of powdered old gold.&nbsp; There were
red, coppery gleams on the roofs of houses, on the corners of
walls, on the panels of carriages, on the very coats of the
horses, and on the broad back of Mr Verloc&rsquo;s overcoat,
where they produced a dull effect of rustiness.&nbsp; But Mr
Verloc was not in the least conscious of having got rusty.&nbsp;
He surveyed through the park railings the evidences of the
town&rsquo;s opulence and luxury with an approving eye.&nbsp; All
these people had to be protected.&nbsp; Protection is the first
necessity of opulence and luxury.&nbsp; They had to be protected;
and their horses, carriages, houses, servants had to be
protected; and the source of their wealth had to be protected in
the heart of the city and the heart of the country; the whole
social order favourable to their hygienic idleness had to be
protected against the shallow enviousness of unhygienic
labour.&nbsp; It had to&mdash;and Mr Verloc would have rubbed his
hands with satisfaction had he not been constitutionally averse
from every superfluous exertion.&nbsp; His idleness was not
hygienic, but it suited him very well.&nbsp; He was in a manner
devoted to it with a sort of inert fanaticism, or perhaps rather
with a fanatical inertness.&nbsp; Born of industrious parents for
a life of toil, he had embraced indolence from an impulse as
profound as inexplicable and as imperious as the impulse which
directs a man&rsquo;s preference for one particular woman in a
given thousand.&nbsp; He was too lazy even for a mere demagogue,
for a workman orator, for a leader of labour.&nbsp; It was too
much trouble.&nbsp; He required a more perfect form of ease; or
it might have been that he was the victim of a philosophical
unbelief in the effectiveness of every human effort.&nbsp; Such a
form of indolence requires, implies, a certain amount of
intelligence.&nbsp; Mr Verloc was not devoid of
intelligence&mdash;and at the notion of a menaced social order he
would perhaps have winked to himself if there had not been an
effort to make in that sign of scepticism.&nbsp; His big,
prominent eyes were not well adapted to winking.&nbsp; They were
rather of the sort that closes solemnly in slumber with majestic
effect.</p>
<p>Undemonstrative and burly in a fat-pig style, Mr Verloc,
without either rubbing his hands with satisfaction or winking
sceptically at his thoughts, proceeded on his way.&nbsp; He trod
the pavement heavily with his shiny boots, and his general get-up
was that of a well-to-do mechanic in business for himself.&nbsp;
He might have been anything from a picture-frame maker to a
lock-smith; an employer of labour in a small way.&nbsp; But there
was also about him an indescribable air which no mechanic could
have acquired in the practice of his handicraft however
dishonestly exercised: the air common to men who live on the
vices, the follies, or the baser fears of mankind; the air of
moral nihilism common to keepers of gambling hells and disorderly
houses; to private detectives and inquiry agents; to drink
sellers and, I should say, to the sellers of invigorating
electric belts and to the inventors of patent medicines.&nbsp;
But of that last I am not sure, not having carried my
investigations so far into the depths.&nbsp; For all I know, the
expression of these last may be perfectly diabolic.&nbsp; I
shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.&nbsp; What I want to affirm is that
Mr Verloc&rsquo;s expression was by no means diabolic.</p>
<p>Before reaching Knightsbridge, Mr Verloc took a turn to the
left out of the busy main thoroughfare, uproarious with the
traffic of swaying omnibuses and trotting vans, in the almost
silent, swift flow of hansoms.&nbsp; Under his hat, worn with a
slight backward tilt, his hair had been carefully brushed into
respectful sleekness; for his business was with an Embassy.&nbsp;
And Mr Verloc, steady like a rock&mdash;a soft kind of
rock&mdash;marched now along a street which could with every
propriety be described as private.&nbsp; In its breadth,
emptiness, and extent it had the majesty of inorganic nature, of
matter that never dies.&nbsp; The only reminder of mortality was
a doctor&rsquo;s brougham arrested in august solitude close to
the curbstone.&nbsp; The polished knockers of the doors gleamed
as far as the eye could reach, the clean windows shone with a
dark opaque lustre.&nbsp; And all was still.&nbsp; But a milk
cart rattled noisily across the distant perspective; a butcher
boy, driving with the noble recklessness of a charioteer at
Olympic Games, dashed round the corner sitting high above a pair
of red wheels.&nbsp; A guilty-looking cat issuing from under the
stones ran for a while in front of Mr Verloc, then dived into
another basement; and a thick police constable, looking a
stranger to every emotion, as if he too were part of inorganic
nature, surging apparently out of a lamp-post, took not the
slightest notice of Mr Verloc.&nbsp; With a turn to the left Mr
Verloc pursued his way along a narrow street by the side of a
yellow wall which, for some inscrutable reason, had No. 1 Chesham
Square written on it in black letters.&nbsp; Chesham Square was
at least sixty yards away, and Mr Verloc, cosmopolitan enough not
to be deceived by London&rsquo;s topographical mysteries, held on
steadily, without a sign of surprise or indignation.&nbsp; At
last, with business-like persistency, he reached the Square, and
made diagonally for the number 10.&nbsp; This belonged to an
imposing carriage gate in a high, clean wall between two houses,
of which one rationally enough bore the number 9 and the other
was numbered 37; but the fact that this last belonged to Porthill
Street, a street well known in the neighbourhood, was proclaimed
by an inscription placed above the ground-floor windows by
whatever highly efficient authority is charged with the duty of
keeping track of London&rsquo;s strayed houses.&nbsp; Why powers
are not asked of Parliament (a short act would do) for compelling
those edifices to return where they belong is one of the
mysteries of municipal administration.&nbsp; Mr Verloc did not
trouble his head about it, his mission in life being the
protection of the social mechanism, not its perfectionment or
even its criticism.</p>
<p>It was so early that the porter of the Embassy issued
hurriedly out of his lodge still struggling with the left sleeve
of his livery coat.&nbsp; His waistcoat was red, and he wore
knee-breeches, but his aspect was flustered.&nbsp; Mr Verloc,
aware of the rush on his flank, drove it off by simply holding
out an envelope stamped with the arms of the Embassy, and passed
on.&nbsp; He produced the same talisman also to the footman who
opened the door, and stood back to let him enter the hall.</p>
<p>A clear fire burned in a tall fireplace, and an elderly man
standing with his back to it, in evening dress and with a chain
round his neck, glanced up from the newspaper he was holding
spread out in both hands before his calm and severe face.&nbsp;
He didn&rsquo;t move; but another lackey, in brown trousers and
claw-hammer coat edged with thin yellow cord, approaching Mr
Verloc listened to the murmur of his name, and turning round on
his heel in silence, began to walk, without looking back
once.&nbsp; Mr Verloc, thus led along a ground-floor passage to
the left of the great carpeted staircase, was suddenly motioned
to enter a quite small room furnished with a heavy writing-table
and a few chairs.&nbsp; The servant shut the door, and Mr Verloc
remained alone.&nbsp; He did not take a seat.&nbsp; With his hat
and stick held in one hand he glanced about, passing his other
podgy hand over his uncovered sleek head.</p>
<p>Another door opened noiselessly, and Mr Verloc immobilising
his glance in that direction saw at first only black clothes, the
bald top of a head, and a drooping dark grey whisker on each side
of a pair of wrinkled hands.&nbsp; The person who had entered was
holding a batch of papers before his eyes and walked up to the
table with a rather mincing step, turning the papers over the
while.&nbsp; Privy Councillor Wurmt, Chancelier
d&rsquo;Ambassade, was rather short-sighted.&nbsp; This
meritorious official laying the papers on the table, disclosed a
face of pasty complexion and of melancholy ugliness surrounded by
a lot of fine, long dark grey hairs, barred heavily by thick and
bushy eyebrows.&nbsp; He put on a black-framed pince-nez upon a
blunt and shapeless nose, and seemed struck by Mr Verloc&rsquo;s
appearance.&nbsp; Under the enormous eyebrows his weak eyes
blinked pathetically through the glasses.</p>
<p>He made no sign of greeting; neither did Mr Verloc, who
certainly knew his place; but a subtle change about the general
outlines of his shoulders and back suggested a slight bending of
Mr Verloc&rsquo;s spine under the vast surface of his
overcoat.&nbsp; The effect was of unobtrusive deference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have here some of your reports,&rdquo; said the
bureaucrat in an unexpectedly soft and weary voice, and pressing
the tip of his forefinger on the papers with force.&nbsp; He
paused; and Mr Verloc, who had recognised his own handwriting
very well, waited in an almost breathless silence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are not very satisfied with the attitude of the police
here,&rdquo; the other continued, with every appearance of mental
fatigue.</p>
<p>The shoulders of Mr Verloc, without actually moving, suggested
a shrug.&nbsp; And for the first time since he left his home that
morning his lips opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every country has its police,&rdquo; he said
philosophically.&nbsp; But as the official of the Embassy went on
blinking at him steadily he felt constrained to add: &ldquo;Allow
me to observe that I have no means of action upon the police
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is desired,&rdquo; said the man of papers,
&ldquo;is the occurrence of something definite which should
stimulate their vigilance.&nbsp; That is within your
province&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc made no answer except by a sigh, which escaped him
involuntarily, for instantly he tried to give his face a cheerful
expression.&nbsp; The official blinked doubtfully, as if affected
by the dim light of the room.&nbsp; He repeated vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vigilance of the police&mdash;and the severity of
the magistrates.&nbsp; The general leniency of the judicial
procedure here, and the utter absence of all repressive measures,
are a scandal to Europe.&nbsp; What is wished for just now is the
accentuation of the unrest&mdash;of the fermentation which
undoubtedly exists&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly, undoubtedly,&rdquo; broke in Mr Verloc in
a deep deferential bass of an oratorical quality, so utterly
different from the tone in which he had spoken before that his
interlocutor remained profoundly surprised.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
exists to a dangerous degree.&nbsp; My reports for the last
twelve months make it sufficiently clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your reports for the last twelve months,&rdquo; State
Councillor Wurmt began in his gentle and dispassionate tone,
&ldquo;have been read by me.&nbsp; I failed to discover why you
wrote them at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sad silence reigned for a time.&nbsp; Mr Verloc seemed to
have swallowed his tongue, and the other gazed at the papers on
the table fixedly.&nbsp; At last he gave them a slight push.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The state of affairs you expose there is assumed to
exist as the first condition of your employment.&nbsp; What is
required at present is not writing, but the bringing to light of
a distinct, significant fact&mdash;I would almost say of an
alarming fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not say that all my endeavours shall be directed
to that end,&rdquo; Mr Verloc said, with convinced modulations in
his conversational husky tone.&nbsp; But the sense of being
blinked at watchfully behind the blind glitter of these
eye-glasses on the other side of the table disconcerted
him.&nbsp; He stopped short with a gesture of absolute
devotion.&nbsp; The useful, hard-working, if obscure member of
the Embassy had an air of being impressed by some newly-born
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very corpulent,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>This observation, really of a psychological nature, and
advanced with the modest hesitation of an officeman more familiar
with ink and paper than with the requirements of active life,
stung Mr Verloc in the manner of a rude personal remark.&nbsp; He
stepped back a pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; What were you pleased to say?&rdquo; he
exclaimed, with husky resentment.</p>
<p>The Chancelier d&rsquo;Ambassade entrusted with the conduct of
this interview seemed to find it too much for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you had better see
Mr Vladimir.&nbsp; Yes, decidedly I think you ought to see Mr
Vladimir.&nbsp; Be good enough to wait here,&rdquo; he added, and
went out with mincing steps.</p>
<p>At once Mr Verloc passed his hand over his hair.&nbsp; A
slight perspiration had broken out on his forehead.&nbsp; He let
the air escape from his pursed-up lips like a man blowing at a
spoonful of hot soup.&nbsp; But when the servant in brown
appeared at the door silently, Mr Verloc had not moved an inch
from the place he had occupied throughout the interview.&nbsp; He
had remained motionless, as if feeling himself surrounded by
pitfalls.</p>
<p>He walked along a passage lighted by a lonely gas-jet, then up
a flight of winding stairs, and through a glazed and cheerful
corridor on the first floor.&nbsp; The footman threw open a door,
and stood aside.&nbsp; The feet of Mr Verloc felt a thick
carpet.&nbsp; The room was large, with three windows; and a young
man with a shaven, big face, sitting in a roomy arm-chair before
a vast mahogany writing-table, said in French to the Chancelier
d&rsquo;Ambassade, who was going out with the papers in his
hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right, mon cher.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
fat&mdash;the animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir, First Secretary, had a drawing-room reputation as
an agreeable and entertaining man.&nbsp; He was something of a
favourite in society.&nbsp; His wit consisted in discovering
droll connections between incongruous ideas; and when talking in
that strain he sat well forward of his seat, with his left hand
raised, as if exhibiting his funny demonstrations between the
thumb and forefinger, while his round and clean-shaven face wore
an expression of merry perplexity.</p>
<p>But there was no trace of merriment or perplexity in the way
he looked at Mr Verloc.&nbsp; Lying far back in the deep
arm-chair, with squarely spread elbows, and throwing one leg over
a thick knee, he had with his smooth and rosy countenance the air
of a preternaturally thriving baby that will not stand nonsense
from anybody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand French, I suppose?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc stated huskily that he did.&nbsp; His whole vast
bulk had a forward inclination.&nbsp; He stood on the carpet in
the middle of the room, clutching his hat and stick in one hand;
the other hung lifelessly by his side.&nbsp; He muttered
unobtrusively somewhere deep down in his throat something about
having done his military service in the French artillery.&nbsp;
At once, with contemptuous perversity, Mr Vladimir changed the
language, and began to speak idiomatic English without the
slightest trace of a foreign accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s
see.&nbsp; How much did you get for obtaining the design of the
improved breech-block of their new field-gun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five years&rsquo; rigorous confinement in a
fortress,&rdquo; Mr Verloc answered unexpectedly, but without any
sign of feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got off easily,&rdquo; was Mr Vladimir&rsquo;s
comment.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, anyhow, it served you right for
letting yourself get caught.&nbsp; What made you go in for that
sort of thing&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc&rsquo;s husky conversational voice was heard
speaking of youth, of a fatal infatuation for an
unworthy&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&nbsp; Cherchez la femme,&rdquo; Mr Vladimir
deigned to interrupt, unbending, but without affability; there
was, on the contrary, a touch of grimness in his
condescension.&nbsp; &ldquo;How long have you been employed by
the Embassy here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since the time of the late Baron
Stott-Wartenheim,&rdquo; Mr Verloc answered in subdued tones, and
protruding his lips sadly, in sign of sorrow for the deceased
diplomat.&nbsp; The First Secretary observed this play of
physiognomy steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! ever since.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; What have you got to
say for yourself?&rdquo; he asked sharply.</p>
<p>Mr Verloc answered with some surprise that he was not aware of
having anything special to say.&nbsp; He had been summoned by a
letter&mdash;And he plunged his hand busily into the side pocket
of his overcoat, but before the mocking, cynical watchfulness of
Mr Vladimir, concluded to leave it there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said that latter.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you
mean by getting out of condition like this?&nbsp; You
haven&rsquo;t got even the physique of your profession.&nbsp;
You&mdash;a member of a starving proletariat&mdash;never!&nbsp;
You&mdash;a desperate socialist or anarchist&mdash;which is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anarchist,&rdquo; stated Mr Verloc in a deadened
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; went on Mr Vladimir, without raising his
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You startled old Wurmt himself.&nbsp; You
wouldn&rsquo;t deceive an idiot.&nbsp; They all are that
by-the-by, but you seem to me simply impossible.&nbsp; So you
began your connection with us by stealing the French gun
designs.&nbsp; And you got yourself caught.&nbsp; That must have
been very disagreeable to our Government.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
seem to be very smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc tried to exculpate himself huskily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve had occasion to observe before, a fatal
infatuation for an unworthy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir raised a large white, plump hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,
yes.&nbsp; The unlucky attachment&mdash;of your youth.&nbsp; She
got hold of the money, and then sold you to the
police&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doleful change in Mr Verloc&rsquo;s physiognomy, the
momentary drooping of his whole person, confessed that such was
the regrettable case.&nbsp; Mr Vladimir&rsquo;s hand clasped the
ankle reposing on his knee.&nbsp; The sock was of dark blue
silk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, that was not very clever of you.&nbsp; Perhaps
you are too susceptible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc intimated in a throaty, veiled murmur that he was no
longer young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a failing which age does not
cure,&rdquo; Mr Vladimir remarked, with sinister
familiarity.&nbsp; &ldquo;But no!&nbsp; You are too fat for
that.&nbsp; You could not have come to look like this if you had
been at all susceptible.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think
is the matter: you are a lazy fellow.&nbsp; How long have you
been drawing pay from this Embassy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven years,&rdquo; was the answer, after a moment of
sulky hesitation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been charged with
several missions to London while His Excellency Baron
Stott-Wartenheim was still Ambassador in Paris.&nbsp; Then by his
Excellency&rsquo;s instructions I settled down in London.&nbsp; I
am English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are!&nbsp; Are you?&nbsp; Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A natural-born British subject,&rdquo; Mr Verloc said
stolidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But my father was French, and
so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind explaining,&rdquo; interrupted the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;I daresay you could have been legally a
Marshal of France and a Member of Parliament in England&mdash;and
then, indeed, you would have been of some use to our
Embassy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This flight of fancy provoked something like a faint smile on
Mr Verloc&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Mr Vladimir retained an
imperturbable gravity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, as I&rsquo;ve said, you are a lazy fellow; you
don&rsquo;t use your opportunities.&nbsp; In the time of Baron
Stott-Wartenheim we had a lot of soft-headed people running this
Embassy.&nbsp; They caused fellows of your sort to form a false
conception of the nature of a secret service fund.&nbsp; It is my
business to correct this misapprehension by telling you what the
secret service is not.&nbsp; It is not a philanthropic
institution.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had you called here on purpose to
tell you this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir observed the forced expression of bewilderment on
Verloc&rsquo;s face, and smiled sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that you understand me perfectly.&nbsp; I daresay
you are intelligent enough for your work.&nbsp; What we want now
is activity&mdash;activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On repeating this last word Mr Vladimir laid a long white
forefinger on the edge of the desk.&nbsp; Every trace of
huskiness disappeared from Verloc&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; The nape
of his gross neck became crimson above the velvet collar of his
overcoat.&nbsp; His lips quivered before they came widely
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll only be good enough to look up my
record,&rdquo; he boomed out in his great, clear oratorical bass,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll see I gave a warning only three months ago,
on the occasion of the Grand Duke Romuald&rsquo;s visit to Paris,
which was telegraphed from here to the French police,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; broke out Mr Vladimir, with a frowning
grimace.&nbsp; &ldquo;The French police had no use for your
warning.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t roar like this.&nbsp; What the devil
do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a note of proud humility Mr Verloc apologised for
forgetting himself.&nbsp; His voice,&mdash;famous for years at
open-air meetings and at workmen&rsquo;s assemblies in large
halls, had contributed, he said, to his reputation of a good and
trustworthy comrade.&nbsp; It was, therefore, a part of his
usefulness.&nbsp; It had inspired confidence in his
principles.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was always put up to speak by the
leaders at a critical moment,&rdquo; Mr Verloc declared, with
obvious satisfaction.&nbsp; There was no uproar above which he
could not make himself heard, he added; and suddenly he made a
demonstration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; With lowered forehead,
without looking up, swiftly and ponderously he crossed the room
to one of the French windows.&nbsp; As if giving way to an
uncontrollable impulse, he opened it a little.&nbsp; Mr Vladimir,
jumping up amazed from the depths of the arm-chair, looked over
his shoulder; and below, across the courtyard of the Embassy,
well beyond the open gate, could be seen the broad back of a
policeman watching idly the gorgeous perambulator of a wealthy
baby being wheeled in state across the Square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constable!&rdquo; said Mr Verloc, with no more effort
than if he were whispering; and Mr Vladimir burst into a laugh on
seeing the policeman spin round as if prodded by a sharp
instrument.&nbsp; Mr Verloc shut the window quietly, and returned
to the middle of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a voice like that,&rdquo; he said, putting on the
husky conversational pedal, &ldquo;I was naturally trusted.&nbsp;
And I knew what to say, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir, arranging his cravat, observed him in the glass
over the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay you have the social revolutionary jargon by
heart well enough,&rdquo; he said contemptuously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Vox et. . . You haven&rsquo;t ever studied
Latin&mdash;have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; growled Mr Verloc.&nbsp; &ldquo;You did not
expect me to know it.&nbsp; I belong to the million.&nbsp; Who
knows Latin?&nbsp; Only a few hundred imbeciles who aren&rsquo;t
fit to take care of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some thirty seconds longer Mr Vladimir studied in the
mirror the fleshy profile, the gross bulk, of the man behind
him.&nbsp; And at the same time he had the advantage of seeing
his own face, clean-shaved and round, rosy about the gills, and
with the thin sensitive lips formed exactly for the utterance of
those delicate witticisms which had made him such a favourite in
the very highest society.&nbsp; Then he turned, and advanced into
the room with such determination that the very ends of his
quaintly old-fashioned bow necktie seemed to bristle with
unspeakable menaces.&nbsp; The movement was so swift and fierce
that Mr Verloc, casting an oblique glance, quailed inwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&nbsp; You dare be impudent,&rdquo; Mr Vladimir
began, with an amazingly guttural intonation not only utterly
un-English, but absolutely un-European, and startling even to Mr
Verloc&rsquo;s experience of cosmopolitan slums.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
dare!&nbsp; Well, I am going to speak plain English to you.&nbsp;
Voice won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; We have no use for your voice.&nbsp;
We don&rsquo;t want a voice.&nbsp; We want facts&mdash;startling
facts&mdash;damn you,&rdquo; he added, with a sort of ferocious
discretion, right into Mr Verloc&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you try to come over me with your
Hyperborean manners,&rdquo; Mr Verloc defended himself huskily,
looking at the carpet.&nbsp; At this his interlocutor, smiling
mockingly above the bristling bow of his necktie, switched the
conversation into French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You give yourself for an &lsquo;agent
provocateur.&rsquo;&nbsp; The proper business of an &lsquo;agent
provocateur&rsquo; is to provoke.&nbsp; As far as I can judge
from your record kept here, you have done nothing to earn your
money for the last three years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; exclaimed Verloc, stirring not a limb,
and not raising his eyes, but with the note of sincere feeling in
his tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have several times prevented what might
have been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a proverb in this country which says
prevention is better than cure,&rdquo; interrupted Mr Vladimir,
throwing himself into the arm-chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is stupid in
a general way.&nbsp; There is no end to prevention.&nbsp; But it
is characteristic.&nbsp; They dislike finality in this
country.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you be too English.&nbsp; And in this
particular instance, don&rsquo;t be absurd.&nbsp; The evil is
already here.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want prevention&mdash;we want
cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, turned to the desk, and turning over some papers
lying there, spoke in a changed business-like tone, without
looking at Mr Verloc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, of course, of the International Conference
assembled in Milan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc intimated hoarsely that he was in the habit of
reading the daily papers.&nbsp; To a further question his answer
was that, of course, he understood what he read.&nbsp; At this Mr
Vladimir, smiling faintly at the documents he was still scanning
one after another, murmured &ldquo;As long as it is not written
in Latin, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or Chinese,&rdquo; added Mr Verloc stolidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m.&nbsp; Some of your revolutionary
friends&rsquo; effusions are written in a <i>charabia</i> every
bit as incomprehensible as Chinese&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr
Vladimir let fall disdainfully a grey sheet of printed
matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are all these leaflets headed F. P.,
with a hammer, pen, and torch crossed?&nbsp; What does it mean,
this F. P.?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr Verloc approached the imposing
writing-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Future of the Proletariat.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
society,&rdquo; he explained, standing ponderously by the side of
the arm-chair, &ldquo;not anarchist in principle, but open to all
shades of revolutionary opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the Vice-Presidents,&rdquo; Mr Verloc breathed
out heavily; and the First Secretary of the Embassy raised his
head to look at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself,&rdquo; he
said incisively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t your society capable of
anything else but printing this prophetic bosh in blunt type on
this filthy paper eh?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you do
something?&nbsp; Look here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve this matter in hand
now, and I tell you plainly that you will have to earn your
money.&nbsp; The good old Stott-Wartenheim times are over.&nbsp;
No work, no pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc felt a queer sensation of faintness in his stout
legs.&nbsp; He stepped back one pace, and blew his nose
loudly.</p>
<p>He was, in truth, startled and alarmed.&nbsp; The rusty London
sunshine struggling clear of the London mist shed a lukewarm
brightness into the First Secretary&rsquo;s private room; and in
the silence Mr Verloc heard against a window-pane the faint
buzzing of a fly&mdash;his first fly of the year&mdash;heralding
better than any number of swallows the approach of spring.&nbsp;
The useless fussing of that tiny energetic organism affected
unpleasantly this big man threatened in his indolence.</p>
<p>In the pause Mr Vladimir formulated in his mind a series of
disparaging remarks concerning Mr Verloc&rsquo;s face and
figure.&nbsp; The fellow was unexpectedly vulgar, heavy, and
impudently unintelligent.&nbsp; He looked uncommonly like a
master plumber come to present his bill.&nbsp; The First
Secretary of the Embassy, from his occasional excursions into the
field of American humour, had formed a special notion of that
class of mechanic as the embodiment of fraudulent laziness and
incompetency.</p>
<p>This was then the famous and trusty secret agent, so secret
that he was never designated otherwise but by the symbol [delta]
in the late Baron Stott-Wartenheim&rsquo;s official,
semi-official, and confidential correspondence; the celebrated
agent [delta], whose warnings had the power to change the schemes
and the dates of royal, imperial, grand ducal journeys, and
sometimes caused them to be put off altogether!&nbsp; This
fellow!&nbsp; And Mr Vladimir indulged mentally in an enormous
and derisive fit of merriment, partly at his own astonishment,
which he judged naive, but mostly at the expense of the
universally regretted Baron Stott-Wartenheim.&nbsp; His late
Excellency, whom the august favour of his Imperial master had
imposed as Ambassador upon several reluctant Ministers of Foreign
Affairs, had enjoyed in his lifetime a fame for an owlish,
pessimistic gullibility.&nbsp; His Excellency had the social
revolution on the brain.&nbsp; He imagined himself to be a
diplomatist set apart by a special dispensation to watch the end
of diplomacy, and pretty nearly the end of the world, in a horrid
democratic upheaval.&nbsp; His prophetic and doleful despatches
had been for years the joke of Foreign Offices.&nbsp; He was said
to have exclaimed on his deathbed (visited by his Imperial friend
and master): &ldquo;Unhappy Europe!&nbsp; Thou shalt perish by
the moral insanity of thy children!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was fated to
be the victim of the first humbugging rascal that came along,
thought Mr Vladimir, smiling vaguely at Mr Verloc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to venerate the memory of Baron
Stott-Wartenheim,&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly.</p>
<p>The lowered physiognomy of Mr Verloc expressed a sombre and
weary annoyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me to observe to you,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that I came here because I was summoned by a peremptory
letter.&nbsp; I have been here only twice before in the last
eleven years, and certainly never at eleven in the morning.&nbsp;
It isn&rsquo;t very wise to call me up like this.&nbsp; There is
just a chance of being seen.&nbsp; And that would be no joke for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would destroy my usefulness,&rdquo; continued the
other hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your affair,&rdquo; murmured Mr Vladimir,
with soft brutality.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you cease to be useful you
shall cease to be employed.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Right off.&nbsp; Cut
short.&nbsp; You shall&mdash;&rdquo; Mr Vladimir, frowning,
paused, at a loss for a sufficiently idiomatic expression, and
instantly brightened up, with a grin of beautifully white
teeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall be chucked,&rdquo; he brought out
ferociously.</p>
<p>Once more Mr Verloc had to react with all the force of his
will against that sensation of faintness running down one&rsquo;s
legs which once upon a time had inspired some poor devil with the
felicitous expression: &ldquo;My heart went down into my
boots.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr Verloc, aware of the sensation, raised his
head bravely.</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir bore the look of heavy inquiry with perfect
serenity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we want is to administer a tonic to the Conference
in Milan,&rdquo; he said airily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Its deliberations
upon international action for the suppression of political crime
don&rsquo;t seem to get anywhere.&nbsp; England lags.&nbsp; This
country is absurd with its sentimental regard for individual
liberty.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s intolerable to think that all your
friends have got only to come over to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that way I have them all under my eye,&rdquo; Mr
Verloc interrupted huskily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be much more to the point to have them all
under lock and key.&nbsp; England must be brought into
line.&nbsp; The imbecile bourgeoisie of this country make
themselves the accomplices of the very people whose aim is to
drive them out of their houses to starve in ditches.&nbsp; And
they have the political power still, if they only had the sense
to use it for their preservation.&nbsp; I suppose you agree that
the middle classes are stupid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc agreed hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have no imagination.&nbsp; They are blinded by an
idiotic vanity.&nbsp; What they want just now is a jolly good
scare.&nbsp; This is the psychological moment to set your friends
to work.&nbsp; I have had you called here to develop to you my
idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mr Vladimir developed his idea from on high, with scorn
and condescension, displaying at the same time an amount of
ignorance as to the real aims, thoughts, and methods of the
revolutionary world which filled the silent Mr Verloc with inward
consternation.&nbsp; He confounded causes with effects more than
was excusable; the most distinguished propagandists with
impulsive bomb throwers; assumed organisation where in the nature
of things it could not exist; spoke of the social revolutionary
party one moment as of a perfectly disciplined army, where the
word of chiefs was supreme, and at another as if it had been the
loosest association of desperate brigands that ever camped in a
mountain gorge.&nbsp; Once Mr Verloc had opened his mouth for a
protest, but the raising of a shapely, large white hand arrested
him.&nbsp; Very soon he became too appalled to even try to
protest.&nbsp; He listened in a stillness of dread which
resembled the immobility of profound attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A series of outrages,&rdquo; Mr Vladimir continued
calmly, &ldquo;executed here in this country; not only
<i>planned</i> here&mdash;that would not do&mdash;they would not
mind.&nbsp; Your friends could set half the Continent on fire
without influencing the public opinion here in favour of a
universal repressive legislation.&nbsp; They will not look
outside their backyard here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc cleared his throat, but his heart failed him, and he
said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These outrages need not be especially
sanguinary,&rdquo; Mr Vladimir went on, as if delivering a
scientific lecture, &ldquo;but they must be sufficiently
startling&mdash;effective.&nbsp; Let them be directed against
buildings, for instance.&nbsp; What is the fetish of the hour
that all the bourgeoisie recognise&mdash;eh, Mr
Verloc?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc opened his hands and shrugged his shoulders
slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too lazy to think,&rdquo; was Mr
Vladimir&rsquo;s comment upon that gesture.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pay
attention to what I say.&nbsp; The fetish of to-day is neither
royalty nor religion.&nbsp; Therefore the palace and the church
should be left alone.&nbsp; You understand what I mean, Mr
Verloc?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dismay and the scorn of Mr Verloc found vent in an attempt
at levity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&nbsp; But what of the Embassies?&nbsp; A
series of attacks on the various Embassies,&rdquo; he began; but
he could not withstand the cold, watchful stare of the First
Secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can be facetious, I see,&rdquo; the latter observed
carelessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; It may
enliven your oratory at socialistic congresses.&nbsp; But this
room is no place for it.&nbsp; It would be infinitely safer for
you to follow carefully what I am saying.&nbsp; As you are being
called upon to furnish facts instead of cock-and-bull stories,
you had better try to make your profit off what I am taking the
trouble to explain to you.&nbsp; The sacrosanct fetish of to-day
is science.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you get some of your friends to
go for that wooden-faced panjandrum&mdash;eh?&nbsp; Is it not
part of these institutions which must be swept away before the F.
P. comes along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc said nothing.&nbsp; He was afraid to open his lips
lest a groan should escape him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what you should try for.&nbsp; An attempt upon
a crowned head or on a president is sensational enough in a way,
but not so much as it used to be.&nbsp; It has entered into the
general conception of the existence of all chiefs of state.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s almost conventional&mdash;especially since so many
presidents have been assassinated.&nbsp; Now let us take an
outrage upon&mdash;say a church.&nbsp; Horrible enough at first
sight, no doubt, and yet not so effective as a person of an
ordinary mind might think.&nbsp; No matter how revolutionary and
anarchist in inception, there would be fools enough to give such
an outrage the character of a religious manifestation.&nbsp; And
that would detract from the especial alarming significance we
wish to give to the act.&nbsp; A murderous attempt on a
restaurant or a theatre would suffer in the same way from the
suggestion of non-political passion: the exasperation of a hungry
man, an act of social revenge.&nbsp; All this is used up; it is
no longer instructive as an object lesson in revolutionary
anarchism.&nbsp; Every newspaper has ready-made phrases to
explain such manifestations away.&nbsp; I am about to give you
the philosophy of bomb throwing from my point of view; from the
point of view you pretend to have been serving for the last
eleven years.&nbsp; I will try not to talk above your head.&nbsp;
The sensibilities of the class you are attacking are soon
blunted.&nbsp; Property seems to them an indestructible
thing.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t count upon their emotions either of
pity or fear for very long.&nbsp; A bomb outrage to have any
influence on public opinion now must go beyond the intention of
vengeance or terrorism.&nbsp; It must be purely
destructive.&nbsp; It must be that, and only that, beyond the
faintest suspicion of any other object.&nbsp; You anarchists
should make it clear that you are perfectly determined to make a
clean sweep of the whole social creation.&nbsp; But how to get
that appallingly absurd notion into the heads of the middle
classes so that there should be no mistake?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
the question.&nbsp; By directing your blows at something outside
the ordinary passions of humanity is the answer.&nbsp; Of course,
there is art.&nbsp; A bomb in the National Gallery would make
some noise.&nbsp; But it would not be serious enough.&nbsp; Art
has never been their fetish.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like breaking a few
back windows in a man&rsquo;s house; whereas, if you want to make
him really sit up, you must try at least to raise the roof.&nbsp;
There would be some screaming of course, but from whom?&nbsp;
Artists&mdash;art critics and such like&mdash;people of no
account.&nbsp; Nobody minds what they say.&nbsp; But there is
learning&mdash;science.&nbsp; Any imbecile that has got an income
believes in that.&nbsp; He does not know why, but he believes it
matters somehow.&nbsp; It is the sacrosanct fetish.&nbsp; All the
damned professors are radicals at heart.&nbsp; Let them know that
their great panjandrum has got to go too, to make room for the
Future of the Proletariat.&nbsp; A howl from all these
intellectual idiots is bound to help forward the labours of the
Milan Conference.&nbsp; They will be writing to the papers.&nbsp;
Their indignation would be above suspicion, no material interests
being openly at stake, and it will alarm every selfishness of the
class which should be impressed.&nbsp; They believe that in some
mysterious way science is at the source of their material
prosperity.&nbsp; They do.&nbsp; And the absurd ferocity of such
a demonstration will affect them more profoundly than the
mangling of a whole street&mdash;or theatre&mdash;full of their
own kind.&nbsp; To that last they can always say: &lsquo;Oh!
it&rsquo;s mere class hate.&rsquo;&nbsp; But what is one to say
to an act of destructive ferocity so absurd as to be
incomprehensible, inexplicable, almost unthinkable; in fact,
mad?&nbsp; Madness alone is truly terrifying, inasmuch as you
cannot placate it either by threats, persuasion, or bribes.&nbsp;
Moreover, I am a civilised man.&nbsp; I would never dream of
directing you to organise a mere butchery, even if I expected the
best results from it.&nbsp; But I wouldn&rsquo;t expect from a
butchery the result I want.&nbsp; Murder is always with us.&nbsp;
It is almost an institution.&nbsp; The demonstration must be
against learning&mdash;science.&nbsp; But not every science will
do.&nbsp; The attack must have all the shocking senselessness of
gratuitous blasphemy.&nbsp; Since bombs are your means of
expression, it would be really telling if one could throw a bomb
into pure mathematics.&nbsp; But that is impossible.&nbsp; I have
been trying to educate you; I have expounded to you the higher
philosophy of your usefulness, and suggested to you some
serviceable arguments.&nbsp; The practical application of my
teaching interests <i>you</i> mostly.&nbsp; But from the moment I
have undertaken to interview you I have also given some attention
to the practical aspect of the question.&nbsp; What do you think
of having a go at astronomy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For sometime already Mr Verloc&rsquo;s immobility by the side
of the arm-chair resembled a state of collapsed coma&mdash;a sort
of passive insensibility interrupted by slight convulsive starts,
such as may be observed in the domestic dog having a nightmare on
the hearthrug.&nbsp; And it was in an uneasy doglike growl that
he repeated the word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Astronomy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not recovered thoroughly as yet from that state of
bewilderment brought about by the effort to follow Mr
Vladimir&rsquo;s rapid incisive utterance.&nbsp; It had overcome
his power of assimilation.&nbsp; It had made him angry.&nbsp;
This anger was complicated by incredulity.&nbsp; And suddenly it
dawned upon him that all this was an elaborate joke.&nbsp; Mr
Vladimir exhibited his white teeth in a smile, with dimples on
his round, full face posed with a complacent inclination above
the bristling bow of his neck-tie.&nbsp; The favourite of
intelligent society women had assumed his drawing-room attitude
accompanying the delivery of delicate witticisms.&nbsp; Sitting
well forward, his white hand upraised, he seemed to hold
delicately between his thumb and forefinger the subtlety of his
suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There could be nothing better.&nbsp; Such an outrage
combines the greatest possible regard for humanity with the most
alarming display of ferocious imbecility.&nbsp; I defy the
ingenuity of journalists to persuade their public that any given
member of the proletariat can have a personal grievance against
astronomy.&nbsp; Starvation itself could hardly be dragged in
there&mdash;eh?&nbsp; And there are other advantages.&nbsp; The
whole civilised world has heard of Greenwich.&nbsp; The very
boot-blacks in the basement of Charing Cross Station know
something of it.&nbsp; See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The features of Mr Vladimir, so well known in the best society
by their humorous urbanity, beamed with cynical
self-satisfaction, which would have astonished the intelligent
women his wit entertained so exquisitely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued, with a contemptuous smile,
&ldquo;the blowing up of the first meridian is bound to raise a
howl of execration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A difficult business,&rdquo; Mr Verloc mumbled, feeling
that this was the only safe thing to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you the whole
gang under your hand?&nbsp; The very pick of the basket?&nbsp;
That old terrorist Yundt is here.&nbsp; I see him walking about
Piccadilly in his green havelock almost every day.&nbsp; And
Michaelis, the ticket-of-leave apostle&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean
to say you don&rsquo;t know where he is?&nbsp; Because if you
don&rsquo;t, I can tell you,&rdquo; Mr Vladimir went on
menacingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you imagine that you are the only one
on the secret fund list, you are mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This perfectly gratuitous suggestion caused Mr Verloc to
shuffle his feet slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the whole Lausanne lot&mdash;eh?&nbsp;
Haven&rsquo;t they been flocking over here at the first hint of
the Milan Conference?&nbsp; This is an absurd country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will cost money,&rdquo; Mr Verloc said, by a sort of
instinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cock won&rsquo;t fight,&rdquo; Mr Vladimir
retorted, with an amazingly genuine English accent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get your screw every month, and no more till
something happens.&nbsp; And if nothing happens very soon you
won&rsquo;t get even that.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s your ostensible
occupation?&nbsp; What are you supposed to live by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep a shop,&rdquo; answered Mr Verloc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shop!&nbsp; What sort of shop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stationery, newspapers.&nbsp; My wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your what?&rdquo; interrupted Mr Vladimir in his
guttural Central Asian tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr Verloc raised his husky voice
slightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be damned for a yarn,&rdquo; exclaimed the other
in unfeigned astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Married!&nbsp; And you a
professed anarchist, too!&nbsp; What is this confounded
nonsense?&nbsp; But I suppose it&rsquo;s merely a manner of
speaking.&nbsp; Anarchists don&rsquo;t marry.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
well known.&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It would be
apostasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife isn&rsquo;t one,&rdquo; Mr Verloc mumbled
sulkily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Moreover, it&rsquo;s no concern of
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, it is,&rdquo; snapped Mr Vladimir.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am beginning to be convinced that you are not at all the
man for the work you&rsquo;ve been employed on.&nbsp; Why, you
must have discredited yourself completely in your own world by
your marriage.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t you have managed
without?&nbsp; This is your virtuous attachment&mdash;eh?&nbsp;
What with one sort of attachment and another you are doing away
with your usefulness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc, puffing out his cheeks, let the air escape
violently, and that was all.&nbsp; He had armed himself with
patience.&nbsp; It was not to be tried much longer.&nbsp; The
First Secretary became suddenly very curt, detached, final.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may go now,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;A dynamite
outrage must be provoked.&nbsp; I give you a month.&nbsp; The
sittings of the Conference are suspended.&nbsp; Before it
reassembles again something must have happened here, or your
connection with us ceases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He changed the note once more with an unprincipled
versatility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think over my philosophy,
Mr&mdash;Mr&mdash;Verloc,&rdquo; he said, with a sort of chaffing
condescension, waving his hand towards the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
for the first meridian.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know the middle
classes as well as I do.&nbsp; Their sensibilities are
jaded.&nbsp; The first meridian.&nbsp; Nothing better, and
nothing easier, I should think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had got up, and with his thin sensitive lips twitching
humorously, watched in the glass over the mantelpiece Mr Verloc
backing out of the room heavily, hat and stick in hand.&nbsp; The
door closed.</p>
<p>The footman in trousers, appearing suddenly in the corridor,
let Mr Verloc another way out and through a small door in the
corner of the courtyard.&nbsp; The porter standing at the gate
ignored his exit completely; and Mr Verloc retraced the path of
his morning&rsquo;s pilgrimage as if in a dream&mdash;an angry
dream.&nbsp; This detachment from the material world was so
complete that, though the mortal envelope of Mr Verloc had not
hastened unduly along the streets, that part of him to which it
would be unwarrantably rude to refuse immortality, found itself
at the shop door all at once, as if borne from west to east on
the wings of a great wind.&nbsp; He walked straight behind the
counter, and sat down on a wooden chair that stood there.&nbsp;
No one appeared to disturb his solitude.&nbsp; Stevie, put into a
green baize apron, was now sweeping and dusting upstairs, intent
and conscientious, as though he were playing at it; and Mrs
Verloc, warned in the kitchen by the clatter of the cracked bell,
had merely come to the glazed door of the parlour, and putting
the curtain aside a little, had peered into the dim shop.&nbsp;
Seeing her husband sitting there shadowy and bulky, with his hat
tilted far back on his head, she had at once returned to her
stove.&nbsp; An hour or more later she took the green baize apron
off her brother Stevie, and instructed him to wash his hands and
face in the peremptory tone she had used in that connection for
fifteen years or so&mdash;ever since she had, in fact, ceased to
attend to the boy&rsquo;s hands and face herself.&nbsp; She
spared presently a glance away from her dishing-up for the
inspection of that face and those hands which Stevie, approaching
the kitchen table, offered for her approval with an air of
self-assurance hiding a perpetual residue of anxiety.&nbsp;
Formerly the anger of the father was the supremely effective
sanction of these rites, but Mr Verloc&rsquo;s placidity in
domestic life would have made all mention of anger incredible
even to poor Stevie&rsquo;s nervousness.&nbsp; The theory was
that Mr Verloc would have been inexpressibly pained and shocked
by any deficiency of cleanliness at meal times.&nbsp; Winnie
after the death of her father found considerable consolation in
the feeling that she need no longer tremble for poor
Stevie.&nbsp; She could not bear to see the boy hurt.&nbsp; It
maddened her.&nbsp; As a little girl she had often faced with
blazing eyes the irascible licensed victualler in defence of her
brother.&nbsp; Nothing now in Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s appearance could
lead one to suppose that she was capable of a passionate
demonstration.</p>
<p>She finished her dishing-up.&nbsp; The table was laid in the
parlour.&nbsp; Going to the foot of the stairs, she screamed out
&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then opening the glazed door leading
to the shop, she said quietly &ldquo;Adolf!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr
Verloc had not changed his position; he had not apparently
stirred a limb for an hour and a half.&nbsp; He got up heavily,
and came to his dinner in his overcoat and with his hat on,
without uttering a word.&nbsp; His silence in itself had nothing
startlingly unusual in this household, hidden in the shades of
the sordid street seldom touched by the sun, behind the dim shop
with its wares of disreputable rubbish.&nbsp; Only that day Mr
Verloc&rsquo;s taciturnity was so obviously thoughtful that the
two women were impressed by it.&nbsp; They sat silent themselves,
keeping a watchful eye on poor Stevie, lest he should break out
into one of his fits of loquacity.&nbsp; He faced Mr Verloc
across the table, and remained very good and quiet, staring
vacantly.&nbsp; The endeavour to keep him from making himself
objectionable in any way to the master of the house put no
inconsiderable anxiety into these two women&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That boy,&rdquo; as they alluded to him softly between
themselves, had been a source of that sort of anxiety almost from
the very day of his birth.&nbsp; The late licensed
victualler&rsquo;s humiliation at having such a very peculiar boy
for a son manifested itself by a propensity to brutal treatment;
for he was a person of fine sensibilities, and his sufferings as
a man and a father were perfectly genuine.&nbsp; Afterwards
Stevie had to be kept from making himself a nuisance to the
single gentlemen lodgers, who are themselves a queer lot, and are
easily aggrieved.&nbsp; And there was always the anxiety of his
mere existence to face.&nbsp; Visions of a workhouse infirmary
for her child had haunted the old woman in the basement
breakfast-room of the decayed Belgravian house.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
you had not found such a good husband, my dear,&rdquo; she used
to say to her daughter, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what would have
become of that poor boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Verloc extended as much recognition to Stevie as a man not
particularly fond of animals may give to his wife&rsquo;s beloved
cat; and this recognition, benevolent and perfunctory, was
essentially of the same quality.&nbsp; Both women admitted to
themselves that not much more could be reasonably expected.&nbsp;
It was enough to earn for Mr Verloc the old woman&rsquo;s
reverential gratitude.&nbsp; In the early days, made sceptical by
the trials of friendless life, she used sometimes to ask
anxiously: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think, my dear, that Mr Verloc
is getting tired of seeing Stevie about?&rdquo;&nbsp; To this
Winnie replied habitually by a slight toss of her head.&nbsp;
Once, however, she retorted, with a rather grim pertness:
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to get tired of me first.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
long silence ensued.&nbsp; The mother, with her feet propped up
on a stool, seemed to be trying to get to the bottom of that
answer, whose feminine profundity had struck her all of a
heap.&nbsp; She had never really understood why Winnie had
married Mr Verloc.&nbsp; It was very sensible of her, and
evidently had turned out for the best, but her girl might have
naturally hoped to find somebody of a more suitable age.&nbsp;
There had been a steady young fellow, only son of a butcher in
the next street, helping his father in business, with whom Winnie
had been walking out with obvious gusto.&nbsp; He was dependent
on his father, it is true; but the business was good, and his
prospects excellent.&nbsp; He took her girl to the theatre on
several evenings.&nbsp; Then just as she began to dread to hear
of their engagement (for what could she have done with that big
house alone, with Stevie on her hands), that romance came to an
abrupt end, and Winnie went about looking very dull.&nbsp; But Mr
Verloc, turning up providentially to occupy the first-floor front
bedroom, there had been no more question of the young
butcher.&nbsp; It was clearly providential.</p>
