<p>Mr Verloc, going out in the morning, left his shop nominally
in charge of his brother-in-law.&nbsp; It could be done, because
there was very little business at any time, and practically none
at all before the evening.&nbsp; Mr Verloc cared but little about
his ostensible business.&nbsp; And, moreover, his wife was in
charge of his brother-in-law.</p>
<p>The shop was small, and so was the house.&nbsp; It was one of
those grimy brick houses which existed in large quantities before
the era of reconstruction dawned upon London.&nbsp; The shop was
a square box of a place, with the front glazed in small
panes.&nbsp; In the daytime the door remained closed; in the
evening it stood discreetly but suspiciously ajar.</p>
<p>The window contained photographs of more or less undressed
dancing girls; nondescript packages in wrappers like patent
medicines; closed yellow paper envelopes, very flimsy, and marked
two-and-six in heavy black figures; a few numbers of ancient
French comic publications hung across a string as if to dry; a
dingy blue china bowl, a casket of black wood, bottles of marking
ink, and rubber stamps; a few books, with titles hinting at
impropriety; a few apparently old copies of obscure newspapers,
badly printed, with titles like <i>The Torch</i>, <i>The
Gong</i>&mdash;rousing titles.&nbsp; And the two gas jets inside
the panes were always turned low, either for economy&rsquo;s sake
or for the sake of the customers.</p>
<p>These customers were either very young men, who hung about the
window for a time before slipping in suddenly; or men of a more
mature age, but looking generally as if they were not in
funds.&nbsp; Some of that last kind had the collars of their
overcoats turned right up to their moustaches, and traces of mud
on the bottom of their nether garments, which had the appearance
of being much worn and not very valuable.&nbsp; And the legs
inside them did not, as a general rule, seem of much account
either.&nbsp; With their hands plunged deep in the side pockets
of their coats, they dodged in sideways, one shoulder first, as
if afraid to start the bell going.</p>
<p>The bell, hung on the door by means of a curved ribbon of
steel, was difficult to circumvent.&nbsp; It was hopelessly
cracked; but of an evening, at the slightest provocation, it
clattered behind the customer with impudent virulence.</p>
<p>It clattered; and at that signal, through the dusty glass door
behind the painted deal counter, Mr Verloc would issue hastily
from the parlour at the back.&nbsp; His eyes were naturally
heavy; he had an air of having wallowed, fully dressed, all day
on an unmade bed.&nbsp; Another man would have felt such an
appearance a distinct disadvantage.&nbsp; In a commercial
transaction of the retail order much depends on the
seller&rsquo;s engaging and amiable aspect.&nbsp; But Mr Verloc
knew his business, and remained undisturbed by any sort of
&aelig;sthetic doubt about his appearance.&nbsp; With a firm,
steady-eyed impudence, which seemed to hold back the threat of
some abominable menace, he would proceed to sell over the counter
some object looking obviously and scandalously not worth the
money which passed in the transaction: a small cardboard box with
apparently nothing inside, for instance, or one of those
carefully closed yellow flimsy envelopes, or a soiled volume in
paper covers with a promising title.&nbsp; Now and then it
happened that one of the faded, yellow dancing girls would get
sold to an amateur, as though she had been alive and young.</p>
<p>Sometimes it was Mrs Verloc who would appear at the call of
the cracked bell.&nbsp; Winnie Verloc was a young woman with a
full bust, in a tight bodice, and with broad hips.&nbsp; Her hair
was very tidy.&nbsp; Steady-eyed like her husband, she preserved
an air of unfathomable indifference behind the rampart of the
counter.&nbsp; Then the customer of comparatively tender years
would get suddenly disconcerted at having to deal with a woman,
and with rage in his heart would proffer a request for a bottle
of marking ink, retail value sixpence (price in Verloc&rsquo;s
shop one-and-sixpence), which, once outside, he would drop
stealthily into the gutter.</p>
<p>The evening visitors&mdash;the men with collars turned up and
soft hats rammed down&mdash;nodded familiarly to Mrs Verloc, and
with a muttered greeting, lifted up the flap at the end of the
counter in order to pass into the back parlour, which gave access
to a passage and to a steep flight of stairs.&nbsp; The door of
the shop was the only means of entrance to the house in which Mr
Verloc carried on his business of a seller of shady wares,
exercised his vocation of a protector of society, and cultivated
his domestic virtues.&nbsp; These last were pronounced.&nbsp; He
was thoroughly domesticated.&nbsp; Neither his spiritual, nor his
mental, nor his physical needs were of the kind to take him much
abroad.&nbsp; He found at home the ease of his body and the peace
of his conscience, together with Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s wifely
attentions and Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s deferential
regard.</p>
<p>Winnie&rsquo;s mother was a stout, wheezy woman, with a large
brown face.&nbsp; She wore a black wig under a white cap.&nbsp;
Her swollen legs rendered her inactive.&nbsp; She considered
herself to be of French descent, which might have been true; and
after a good many years of married life with a licensed
victualler of the more common sort, she provided for the years of
widowhood by letting furnished apartments for gentlemen near
Vauxhall Bridge Road in a square once of some splendour and still
included in the district of Belgravia.&nbsp; This topographical
fact was of some advantage in advertising her rooms; but the
patrons of the worthy widow were not exactly of the fashionable
kind.&nbsp; Such as they were, her daughter Winnie helped to look
after them.&nbsp; Traces of the French descent which the widow
boasted of were apparent in Winnie too.&nbsp; They were apparent
in the extremely neat and artistic arrangement of her glossy dark
hair.&nbsp; Winnie had also other charms: her youth; her full,
rounded form; her clear complexion; the provocation of her
unfathomable reserve, which never went so far as to prevent
conversation, carried on on the lodgers&rsquo; part with
animation, and on hers with an equable amiability.&nbsp; It must
be that Mr Verloc was susceptible to these fascinations.&nbsp; Mr
Verloc was an intermittent patron.&nbsp; He came and went without
any very apparent reason.&nbsp; He generally arrived in London
(like the influenza) from the Continent, only he arrived
unheralded by the Press; and his visitations set in with great
severity.&nbsp; He breakfasted in bed, and remained wallowing
there with an air of quiet enjoyment till noon every
day&mdash;and sometimes even to a later hour.&nbsp; But when he
went out he seemed to experience a great difficulty in finding
his way back to his temporary home in the Belgravian
square.&nbsp; He left it late, and returned to it early&mdash;as
early as three or four in the morning; and on waking up at ten
addressed Winnie, bringing in the breakfast tray, with jocular,
exhausted civility, in the hoarse, failing tones of a man who had
been talking vehemently for many hours together.&nbsp; His
prominent, heavy-lidded eyes rolled sideways amorously and
languidly, the bedclothes were pulled up to his chin, and his
dark smooth moustache covered his thick lips capable of much
honeyed banter.</p>
<p>In Winnie&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s opinion Mr Verloc was a very
nice gentleman.&nbsp; From her life&rsquo;s experience gathered
in various &ldquo;business houses&rdquo; the good woman had taken
into her retirement an ideal of gentlemanliness as exhibited by
the patrons of private-saloon bars.&nbsp; Mr Verloc approached
that ideal; he attained it, in fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we&rsquo;ll take over your furniture,
mother,&rdquo; Winnie had remarked.</p>
<p>The lodging-house was to be given up.&nbsp; It seems it would
not answer to carry it on.&nbsp; It would have been too much
trouble for Mr Verloc.&nbsp; It would not have been convenient
for his other business.&nbsp; What his business was he did not
say; but after his engagement to Winnie he took the trouble to
get up before noon, and descending the basement stairs, make
himself pleasant to Winnie&rsquo;s mother in the breakfast-room
downstairs where she had her motionless being.&nbsp; He stroked
the cat, poked the fire, had his lunch served to him there.&nbsp;
He left its slightly stuffy cosiness with evident reluctance,
but, all the same, remained out till the night was far
advanced.&nbsp; He never offered to take Winnie to theatres, as
such a nice gentleman ought to have done.&nbsp; His evenings were
occupied.&nbsp; His work was in a way political, he told Winnie
once.&nbsp; She would have, he warned her, to be very nice to his
political friends.</p>
<p>And with her straight, unfathomable glance she answered that
she would be so, of course.</p>
<p>How much more he told her as to his occupation it was
impossible for Winnie&rsquo;s mother to discover.&nbsp; The
married couple took her over with the furniture.&nbsp; The mean
aspect of the shop surprised her.&nbsp; The change from the
Belgravian square to the narrow street in Soho affected her legs
adversely.&nbsp; They became of an enormous size.&nbsp; On the
other hand, she experienced a complete relief from material
cares.&nbsp; Her son-in-law&rsquo;s heavy good nature inspired
her with a sense of absolute safety.&nbsp; Her daughter&rsquo;s
future was obviously assured, and even as to her son Stevie she
need have no anxiety.&nbsp; She had not been able to conceal from
herself that he was a terrible encumbrance, that poor
Stevie.&nbsp; But in view of Winnie&rsquo;s fondness for her
delicate brother, and of Mr Verloc&rsquo;s kind and generous
disposition, she felt that the poor boy was pretty safe in this
rough world.&nbsp; And in her heart of hearts she was not perhaps
displeased that the Verlocs had no children.&nbsp; As that
circumstance seemed perfectly indifferent to Mr Verloc, and as
Winnie found an object of quasi-maternal affection in her
brother, perhaps this was just as well for poor Stevie.</p>
<p>For he was difficult to dispose of, that boy.&nbsp; He was
delicate and, in a frail way, good-looking too, except for the
vacant droop of his lower lip.&nbsp; Under our excellent system
of compulsory education he had learned to read and write,
notwithstanding the unfavourable aspect of the lower lip.&nbsp;
But as errand-boy he did not turn out a great success.&nbsp; He
forgot his messages; he was easily diverted from the straight
path of duty by the attractions of stray cats and dogs, which he
followed down narrow alleys into unsavoury courts; by the
comedies of the streets, which he contemplated open-mouthed, to
the detriment of his employer&rsquo;s interests; or by the dramas
of fallen horses, whose pathos and violence induced him sometimes
to shriek pierceingly in a crowd, which disliked to be disturbed
by sounds of distress in its quiet enjoyment of the national
spectacle.&nbsp; When led away by a grave and protecting
policeman, it would often become apparent that poor Stevie had
forgotten his address&mdash;at least for a time.&nbsp; A brusque
question caused him to stutter to the point of suffocation.&nbsp;
When startled by anything perplexing he used to squint
horribly.&nbsp; However, he never had any fits (which was
encouraging); and before the natural outbursts of impatience on
the part of his father he could always, in his childhood&rsquo;s
days, run for protection behind the short skirts of his sister
Winnie.&nbsp; On the other hand, he might have been suspected of
hiding a fund of reckless naughtiness.&nbsp; When he had reached
the age of fourteen a friend of his late father, an agent for a
foreign preserved milk firm, having given him an opening as
office-boy, he was discovered one foggy afternoon, in his
chief&rsquo;s absence, busy letting off fireworks on the
staircase.&nbsp; He touched off in quick succession a set of
fierce rockets, angry catherine wheels, loudly exploding
squibs&mdash;and the matter might have turned out very
serious.&nbsp; An awful panic spread through the whole
building.&nbsp; Wild-eyed, choking clerks stampeded through the
passages full of smoke, silk hats and elderly business men could
be seen rolling independently down the stairs.&nbsp; Stevie did
not seem to derive any personal gratification from what he had
done.&nbsp; His motives for this stroke of originality were
difficult to discover.&nbsp; It was only later on that Winnie
obtained from him a misty and confused confession.&nbsp; It seems
that two other office-boys in the building had worked upon his
feelings by tales of injustice and oppression till they had
wrought his compassion to the pitch of that frenzy.&nbsp; But his
father&rsquo;s friend, of course, dismissed him summarily as
likely to ruin his business.&nbsp; After that altruistic exploit
Stevie was put to help wash the dishes in the basement kitchen,
and to black the boots of the gentlemen patronising the
Belgravian mansion.&nbsp; There was obviously no future in such
work.&nbsp; The gentlemen tipped him a shilling now and
then.&nbsp; Mr Verloc showed himself the most generous of
lodgers.&nbsp; But altogether all that did not amount to much
either in the way of gain or prospects; so that when Winnie
announced her engagement to Mr Verloc her mother could not help
wondering, with a sigh and a glance towards the scullery, what
would become of poor Stephen now.</p>
<p>It appeared that Mr Verloc was ready to take him over together
with his wife&rsquo;s mother and with the furniture, which was
the whole visible fortune of the family.&nbsp; Mr Verloc gathered
everything as it came to his broad, good-natured breast.&nbsp;
The furniture was disposed to the best advantage all over the
house, but Mrs Verloc&rsquo;s mother was confined to two back
rooms on the first floor.&nbsp; The luckless Stevie slept in one
of them.&nbsp; By this time a growth of thin fluffy hair had come
to blur, like a golden mist, the sharp line of his small lower
jaw.&nbsp; He helped his sister with blind love and docility in
her household duties.&nbsp; Mr Verloc thought that some
occupation would be good for him.&nbsp; His spare time he
occupied by drawing circles with compass and pencil on a piece of
paper.&nbsp; He applied himself to that pastime with great
industry, with his elbows spread out and bowed low over the
kitchen table.&nbsp; Through the open door of the parlour at the
back of the shop Winnie, his sister, glanced at him from time to
time with maternal vigilance.</p>
