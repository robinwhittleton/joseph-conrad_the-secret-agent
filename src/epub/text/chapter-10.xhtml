<p>The Assistant Commissioner, driven rapidly in a hansom from
the neighbourhood of Soho in the direction of Westminster, got
out at the very centre of the Empire on which the sun never
sets.&nbsp; Some stalwart constables, who did not seem
particularly impressed by the duty of watching the august spot,
saluted him.&nbsp; Penetrating through a portal by no means lofty
into the precincts of the House which is <i>the</i> House, <i>par
excellence</i> in the minds of many millions of men, he was met
at last by the volatile and revolutionary Toodles.</p>
<p>That neat and nice young man concealed his astonishment at the
early appearance of the Assistant Commissioner, whom he had been
told to look out for some time about midnight.&nbsp; His turning
up so early he concluded to be the sign that things, whatever
they were, had gone wrong.&nbsp; With an extremely ready
sympathy, which in nice youngsters goes often with a joyous
temperament, he felt sorry for the great Presence he called
&ldquo;The Chief,&rdquo; and also for the Assistant Commissioner,
whose face appeared to him more ominously wooden than ever
before, and quite wonderfully long.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a queer,
foreign-looking chap he is,&rdquo; he thought to himself, smiling
from a distance with friendly buoyancy.&nbsp; And directly they
came together he began to talk with the kind intention of burying
the awkwardness of failure under a heap of words.&nbsp; It looked
as if the great assault threatened for that night were going to
fizzle out.&nbsp; An inferior henchman of &ldquo;that brute
Cheeseman&rdquo; was up boring mercilessly a very thin House with
some shamelessly cooked statistics.&nbsp; He, Toodles, hoped he
would bore them into a count out every minute.&nbsp; But then he
might be only marking time to let that guzzling Cheeseman dine at
his leisure.&nbsp; Anyway, the Chief could not be persuaded to go
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will see you at once, I think.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
sitting all alone in his room thinking of all the fishes of the
sea,&rdquo; concluded Toodles airily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the kindness of his disposition, the young
private secretary (unpaid) was accessible to the common failings
of humanity.&nbsp; He did not wish to harrow the feelings of the
Assistant Commissioner, who looked to him uncommonly like a man
who has made a mess of his job.&nbsp; But his curiosity was too
strong to be restrained by mere compassion.&nbsp; He could not
help, as they went along, to throw over his shoulder lightly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your sprat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got him,&rdquo; answered the Assistant Commissioner
with a concision which did not mean to be repellent in the
least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve no idea how these great men
dislike to be disappointed in small things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this profound observation the experienced Toodles seemed
to reflect.&nbsp; At any rate he said nothing for quite two
seconds.&nbsp; Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad.&nbsp; But&mdash;I say&mdash;is it
really such a very small thing as you make it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what may be done with a sprat?&rdquo; the
Assistant Commissioner asked in his turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sometimes put into a sardine box,&rdquo;
chuckled Toodles, whose erudition on the subject of the fishing
industry was fresh and, in comparison with his ignorance of all
other industrial matters, immense.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are sardine
canneries on the Spanish coast which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner interrupted the apprentice
statesman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But a sprat is also thrown away
sometimes in order to catch a whale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whale.&nbsp; Phew!&rdquo; exclaimed Toodles, with
bated breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re after a whale,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&nbsp; What I am after is more like a
dog-fish.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know perhaps what a dog-fish is
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I do.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re buried in special books up
to our necks&mdash;whole shelves full of them&mdash;with plates.
. . . It&rsquo;s a noxious, rascally-looking, altogether
detestable beast, with a sort of smooth face and
moustaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Described to a T,&rdquo; commended the Assistant
Commissioner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only mine is clean-shaven
altogether.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve seen him.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a witty
fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen him!&rdquo; said Toodles
incredulously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t conceive where I could
have seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Explorers, I should say,&rdquo; dropped the
Assistant Commissioner calmly.&nbsp; At the name of that
extremely exclusive club Toodles looked scared, and stopped
short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he protested, but in an awe-struck
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean?&nbsp; A member?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honorary,&rdquo; muttered the Assistant Commissioner
through his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toodles looked so thunderstruck that the Assistant
Commissioner smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s between ourselves strictly,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the beastliest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard
in my life,&rdquo; declared Toodles feebly, as if astonishment
had robbed him of all his buoyant strength in a second.</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner gave him an unsmiling glance.&nbsp;
Till they came to the door of the great man&rsquo;s room, Toodles
preserved a scandalised and solemn silence, as though he were
offended with the Assistant Commissioner for exposing such an
unsavoury and disturbing fact.&nbsp; It revolutionised his idea
of the Explorers&rsquo; Club&rsquo;s extreme selectness, of its
social purity.&nbsp; Toodles was revolutionary only in politics;
his social beliefs and personal feelings he wished to preserve
unchanged through all the years allotted to him on this earth
which, upon the whole, he believed to be a nice place to live
on.</p>
<p>He stood aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in without knocking,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Shades of green silk fitted low over all the lights imparted
to the room something of a forest&rsquo;s deep gloom.&nbsp; The
haughty eyes were physically the great man&rsquo;s weak
point.&nbsp; This point was wrapped up in secrecy.&nbsp; When an
opportunity offered, he rested them conscientiously.</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner entering saw at first only a big
pale hand supporting a big head, and concealing the upper part of
a big pale face.&nbsp; An open despatch-box stood on the
writing-table near a few oblong sheets of paper and a scattered
handful of quill pens.&nbsp; There was absolutely nothing else on
the large flat surface except a little bronze statuette draped in
a toga, mysteriously watchful in its shadowy immobility.&nbsp;
The Assistant Commissioner, invited to take a chair, sat
down.&nbsp; In the dim light, the salient points of his
personality, the long face, the black hair, his lankness, made
him look more foreign than ever.</p>
<p>The great man manifested no surprise, no eagerness, no
sentiment whatever.&nbsp; The attitude in which he rested his
menaced eyes was profoundly meditative.&nbsp; He did not alter it
the least bit.&nbsp; But his tone was not dreamy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; What is it that you&rsquo;ve found out
already?&nbsp; You came upon something unexpected on the first
step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly unexpected, Sir Ethelred.&nbsp; What I
mainly came upon was a psychological state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Great Presence made a slight movement.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
must be lucid, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir Ethelred.&nbsp; You know no doubt that most
criminals at some time or other feel an irresistible need of
confessing&mdash;of making a clean breast of it to
somebody&mdash;to anybody.&nbsp; And they do it often to the
police.&nbsp; In that Verloc whom Heat wished so much to screen
I&rsquo;ve found a man in that particular psychological
state.&nbsp; The man, figuratively speaking, flung himself on my
breast.&nbsp; It was enough on my part to whisper to him who I
was and to add &lsquo;I know that you are at the bottom of this
affair.&rsquo;&nbsp; It must have seemed miraculous to him that
we should know already, but he took it all in the stride.&nbsp;
The wonderfulness of it never checked him for a moment.&nbsp;
There remained for me only to put to him the two questions: Who
put you up to it? and Who was the man who did it?&nbsp; He
answered the first with remarkable emphasis.&nbsp; As to the
second question, I gather that the fellow with the bomb was his
brother-in-law&mdash;quite a lad&mdash;a weak-minded creature. .
. . It is rather a curious affair&mdash;too long perhaps to state
fully just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then have you learned?&rdquo; asked the great
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, I&rsquo;ve learned that the ex-convict Michaelis
had nothing to do with it, though indeed the lad had been living
with him temporarily in the country up to eight o&rsquo;clock
this morning.&nbsp; It is more than likely that Michaelis knows
nothing of it to this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are positive as to that?&rdquo; asked the great
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite certain, Sir Ethelred.&nbsp; This fellow Verloc
went there this morning, and took away the lad on the pretence of
going out for a walk in the lanes.&nbsp; As it was not the first
time that he did this, Michaelis could not have the slightest
suspicion of anything unusual.&nbsp; For the rest, Sir Ethelred,
the indignation of this man Verloc had left nothing in
doubt&mdash;nothing whatever.&nbsp; He had been driven out of his
mind almost by an extraordinary performance, which for you or me
it would be difficult to take as seriously meant, but which
produced a great impression obviously on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner then imparted briefly to the great
man, who sat still, resting his eyes under the screen of his
hand, Mr Verloc&rsquo;s appreciation of Mr Vladimir&rsquo;s
proceedings and character.&nbsp; The Assistant Commissioner did
not seem to refuse it a certain amount of competency.&nbsp; But
the great personage remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this seems very fantastic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; One would think a ferocious
joke.&nbsp; But our man took it seriously, it appears.&nbsp; He
felt himself threatened.&nbsp; In the time, you know, he was in
direct communication with old Stott-Wartenheim himself, and had
come to regard his services as indispensable.&nbsp; It was an
extremely rude awakening.&nbsp; I imagine that he lost his
head.&nbsp; He became angry and frightened.&nbsp; Upon my word,
my impression is that he thought these Embassy people quite
capable not only to throw him out but, to give him away too in
some manner or other&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long were you with him,&rdquo; interrupted the
Presence from behind his big hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some forty minutes, Sir Ethelred, in a house of bad
repute called Continental Hotel, closeted in a room which
by-the-by I took for the night.&nbsp; I found him under the
influence of that reaction which follows the effort of
crime.&nbsp; The man cannot be defined as a hardened
criminal.&nbsp; It is obvious that he did not plan the death of
that wretched lad&mdash;his brother-in-law.&nbsp; That was a
shock to him&mdash;I could see that.&nbsp; Perhaps he is a man of
strong sensibilities.&nbsp; Perhaps he was even fond of the
lad&mdash;who knows?&nbsp; He might have hoped that the fellow
would get clear away; in which case it would have been almost
impossible to bring this thing home to anyone.&nbsp; At any rate
he risked consciously nothing more but arrest for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner paused in his speculations to
reflect for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though how, in that last case, he could hope to have
his own share in the business concealed is more than I can
tell,&rdquo; he continued, in his ignorance of poor
Stevie&rsquo;s devotion to Mr Verloc (who was <i>good</i>), and
of his truly peculiar dumbness, which in the old affair of
fireworks on the stairs had for many years resisted entreaties,
coaxing, anger, and other means of investigation used by his
beloved sister.&nbsp; For Stevie was loyal. . . .&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t imagine.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s possible that
he never thought of that at all.&nbsp; It sounds an extravagant
way of putting it, Sir Ethelred, but his state of dismay
suggested to me an impulsive man who, after committing suicide
with the notion that it would end all his troubles, had
discovered that it did nothing of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner gave this definition in an
apologetic voice.&nbsp; But in truth there is a sort of lucidity
proper to extravagant language, and the great man was not
offended.&nbsp; A slight jerky movement of the big body half lost
in the gloom of the green silk shades, of the big head leaning on
the big hand, accompanied an intermittent stifled but powerful
sound.&nbsp; The great man had laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner answered very readily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he seemed very anxious to get back to his wife in
the shop I let him go, Sir Ethelred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did?&nbsp; But the fellow will
disappear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think so.&nbsp; Where
could he go to?&nbsp; Moreover, you must remember that he has got
to think of the danger from his comrades too.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
there at his post.&nbsp; How could he explain leaving it?&nbsp;
But even if there were no obstacles to his freedom of action he
would do nothing.&nbsp; At present he hasn&rsquo;t enough moral
energy to take a resolution of any sort.&nbsp; Permit me also to
point out that if I had detained him we would have been committed
to a course of action on which I wished to know your precise
intentions first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great personage rose heavily, an imposing shadowy form in
the greenish gloom of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see the Attorney-General to-night, and will
send for you to-morrow morning.&nbsp; Is there anything more
you&rsquo;d wish to tell me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner had stood up also, slender and
flexible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not, Sir Ethelred, unless I were to enter into
details which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; No details, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great shadowy form seemed to shrink away as if in physical
dread of details; then came forward, expanded, enormous, and
weighty, offering a large hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you say that
this man has got a wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir Ethelred,&rdquo; said the Assistant
Commissioner, pressing deferentially the extended hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A genuine wife and a genuinely, respectably, marital
relation.&nbsp; He told me that after his interview at the
Embassy he would have thrown everything up, would have tried to
sell his shop, and leave the country, only he felt certain that
his wife would not even hear of going abroad.&nbsp; Nothing could
be more characteristic of the respectable bond than that,&rdquo;
went on, with a touch of grimness, the Assistant Commissioner,
whose own wife too had refused to hear of going abroad.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, a genuine wife.&nbsp; And the victim was a genuine
brother-in-law.&nbsp; From a certain point of view we are here in
the presence of a domestic drama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner laughed a little; but the great
man&rsquo;s thoughts seemed to have wandered far away, perhaps to
the questions of his country&rsquo;s domestic policy, the
battle-ground of his crusading valour against the paynim
Cheeseman.&nbsp; The Assistant Commissioner withdrew quietly,
unnoticed, as if already forgotten.</p>
<p>He had his own crusading instincts.&nbsp; This affair, which,
in one way or another, disgusted Chief Inspector Heat, seemed to
him a providentially given starting-point for a crusade.&nbsp; He
had it much at heart to begin.&nbsp; He walked slowly home,
meditating that enterprise on the way, and thinking over Mr
Verloc&rsquo;s psychology in a composite mood of repugnance and
satisfaction.&nbsp; He walked all the way home.&nbsp; Finding the
drawing-room dark, he went upstairs, and spent some time between
the bedroom and the dressing-room, changing his clothes, going to
and fro with the air of a thoughtful somnambulist.&nbsp; But he
shook it off before going out again to join his wife at the house
of the great lady patroness of Michaelis.</p>
<p>He knew he would be welcomed there.&nbsp; On entering the
smaller of the two drawing-rooms he saw his wife in a small group
near the piano.&nbsp; A youngish composer in pass of becoming
famous was discoursing from a music stool to two thick men whose
backs looked old, and three slender women whose backs looked
young.&nbsp; Behind the screen the great lady had only two
persons with her: a man and a woman, who sat side by side on
arm-chairs at the foot of her couch.&nbsp; She extended her hand
to the Assistant Commissioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never hoped to see you here to-night.&nbsp; Annie
told me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I had no idea myself that my work would be
over so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner added in a low tone:&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am glad to tell you that Michaelis is altogether clear of
this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The patroness of the ex-convict received this assurance
indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&nbsp; Were your people stupid enough to connect
him with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not stupid,&rdquo; interrupted the Assistant
Commissioner, contradicting deferentially.&nbsp; &ldquo;Clever
enough&mdash;quite clever enough for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence fell.&nbsp; The man at the foot of the couch had
stopped speaking to the lady, and looked on with a faint
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you ever met before,&rdquo;
said the great lady.</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir and the Assistant Commissioner, introduced,
acknowledged each other&rsquo;s existence with punctilious and
guarded courtesy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been frightening me,&rdquo; declared
suddenly the lady who sat by the side of Mr Vladimir, with an
inclination of the head towards that gentleman.&nbsp; The
Assistant Commissioner knew the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not look frightened,&rdquo; he pronounced, after
surveying her conscientiously with his tired and equable
gaze.&nbsp; He was thinking meantime to himself that in this
house one met everybody sooner or later.&nbsp; Mr
Vladimir&rsquo;s rosy countenance was wreathed in smiles, because
he was witty, but his eyes remained serious, like the eyes of
convinced man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he tried to at least,&rdquo; amended the
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Force of habit perhaps,&rdquo; said the Assistant
Commissioner, moved by an irresistible inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been threatening society with all sorts of
horrors,&rdquo; continued the lady, whose enunciation was
caressing and slow, &ldquo;apropos of this explosion in Greenwich
Park.&nbsp; It appears we all ought to quake in our shoes at
what&rsquo;s coming if those people are not suppressed all over
the world.&nbsp; I had no idea this was such a grave
affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir, affecting not to listen, leaned towards the
couch, talking amiably in subdued tones, but he heard the
Assistant Commissioner say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt that Mr Vladimir has a very precise
notion of the true importance of this affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir asked himself what that confounded and intrusive
policeman was driving at.&nbsp; Descended from generations
victimised by the instruments of an arbitrary power, he was
racially, nationally, and individually afraid of the
police.&nbsp; It was an inherited weakness, altogether
independent of his judgment, of his reason, of his
experience.&nbsp; He was born to it.&nbsp; But that sentiment,
which resembled the irrational horror some people have of cats,
did not stand in the way of his immense contempt for the English
police.&nbsp; He finished the sentence addressed to the great
lady, and turned slightly in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that we have a great experience of these
people.&nbsp; Yes; indeed, we suffer greatly from their activity,
while you&rdquo;&mdash;Mr Vladimir hesitated for a moment, in
smiling perplexity&mdash;&ldquo;while you suffer their presence
gladly in your midst,&rdquo; he finished, displaying a dimple on
each clean-shaven cheek.&nbsp; Then he added more gravely:
&ldquo;I may even say&mdash;because you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mr Vladimir ceased speaking the Assistant Commissioner
lowered his glance, and the conversation dropped.&nbsp; Almost
immediately afterwards Mr Vladimir took leave.</p>
<p>Directly his back was turned on the couch the Assistant
Commissioner rose too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to stay and take Annie
home,&rdquo; said the lady patroness of Michaelis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find that I&rsquo;ve yet a little work to do
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In connection&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;in a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, what is it really&mdash;this
horror?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to say what it is, but it may yet
be a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>,&rdquo; said the
Assistant Commissioner.</p>
<p>He left the drawing-room hurriedly, and found Mr Vladimir
still in the hall, wrapping up his throat carefully in a large
silk handkerchief.&nbsp; Behind him a footman waited, holding his
overcoat.&nbsp; Another stood ready to open the door.&nbsp; The
Assistant Commissioner was duly helped into his coat, and let out
at once.&nbsp; After descending the front steps he stopped, as if
to consider the way he should take.&nbsp; On seeing this through
the door held open, Mr Vladimir lingered in the hall to get out a
cigar and asked for a light.&nbsp; It was furnished to him by an
elderly man out of livery with an air of calm solicitude.&nbsp;
But the match went out; the footman then closed the door, and Mr
Vladimir lighted his large Havana with leisurely care.</p>
<p>When at last he got out of the house, he saw with disgust the
&ldquo;confounded policeman&rdquo; still standing on the
pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he be waiting for me,&rdquo; thought Mr Vladimir,
looking up and down for some signs of a hansom.&nbsp; He saw
none.&nbsp; A couple of carriages waited by the curbstone, their
lamps blazing steadily, the horses standing perfectly still, as
if carved in stone, the coachmen sitting motionless under the big
fur capes, without as much as a quiver stirring the white thongs
of their big whips.&nbsp; Mr Vladimir walked on, and the
&ldquo;confounded policeman&rdquo; fell into step at his
elbow.&nbsp; He said nothing.&nbsp; At the end of the fourth
stride Mr Vladimir felt infuriated and uneasy.&nbsp; This could
not last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rotten weather,&rdquo; he growled savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mild,&rdquo; said the Assistant Commissioner without
passion.&nbsp; He remained silent for a little while.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got hold of a man called Verloc,&rdquo; he
announced casually.</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir did not stumble, did not stagger back, did not
change his stride.&nbsp; But he could not prevent himself from
exclaiming: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Assistant Commissioner
did not repeat his statement.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know him,&rdquo;
he went on in the same tone.</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir stopped, and became guttural.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
makes you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Verloc who says
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lying dog of some sort,&rdquo; said Mr Vladimir in
somewhat Oriental phraseology.&nbsp; But in his heart he was
almost awed by the miraculous cleverness of the English
police.&nbsp; The change of his opinion on the subject was so
violent that it made him for a moment feel slightly sick.&nbsp;
He threw away his cigar, and moved on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What pleased me most in this affair,&rdquo; the
Assistant went on, talking slowly, &ldquo;is that it makes such
an excellent starting-point for a piece of work which I&rsquo;ve
felt must be taken in hand&mdash;that is, the clearing out of
this country of all the foreign political spies, police, and that
sort of&mdash;of&mdash;dogs.&nbsp; In my opinion they are a
ghastly nuisance; also an element of danger.&nbsp; But we
can&rsquo;t very well seek them out individually.&nbsp; The only
way is to make their employment unpleasant to their
employers.&nbsp; The thing&rsquo;s becoming indecent.&nbsp; And
dangerous too, for us, here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir stopped again for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prosecution of this Verloc will demonstrate to the
public both the danger and the indecency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody will believe what a man of that sort
says,&rdquo; said Mr Vladimir contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wealth and precision of detail will carry
conviction to the great mass of the public,&rdquo; advanced the
Assistant Commissioner gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that is seriously what you mean to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the man; we have no choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be only feeding up the lying spirit of these
revolutionary scoundrels,&rdquo; Mr Vladimir protested.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you want to make a scandal for?&mdash;from
morality&mdash;or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir&rsquo;s anxiety was obvious.&nbsp; The Assistant
Commissioner having ascertained in this way that there must be
some truth in the summary statements of Mr Verloc, said
indifferently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a practical side too.&nbsp; We have
really enough to do to look after the genuine article.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t say we are not effective.&nbsp; But we don&rsquo;t
intend to let ourselves be bothered by shams under any pretext
whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir&rsquo;s tone became lofty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part, I can&rsquo;t share your view.&nbsp; It is
selfish.&nbsp; My sentiments for my own country cannot be
doubted; but I&rsquo;ve always felt that we ought to be good
Europeans besides&mdash;I mean governments and men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Assistant Commissioner
simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only you look at Europe from its other
end.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; he went on in a good-natured tone,
&ldquo;the foreign governments cannot complain of the
inefficiency of our police.&nbsp; Look at this outrage; a case
specially difficult to trace inasmuch as it was a sham.&nbsp; In
less than twelve hours we have established the identity of a man
literally blown to shreds, have found the organiser of the
attempt, and have had a glimpse of the inciter behind him.&nbsp;
And we could have gone further; only we stopped at the limits of
our territory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this instructive crime was planned abroad,&rdquo; Mr
Vladimir said quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You admit it was planned
abroad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theoretically.&nbsp; Theoretically only, on foreign
territory; abroad only by a fiction,&rdquo; said the Assistant
Commissioner, alluding to the character of Embassies, which are
supposed to be part and parcel of the country to which they
belong.&nbsp; &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a detail.&nbsp; I talked to
you of this business because it&rsquo;s your government that
grumbles most at our police.&nbsp; You see that we are not so
bad.&nbsp; I wanted particularly to tell you of our
success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m very grateful,&rdquo; muttered
Mr Vladimir through his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can put our finger on every anarchist here,&rdquo;
went on the Assistant Commissioner, as though he were quoting
Chief Inspector Heat.&nbsp; &ldquo;All that&rsquo;s wanted now is
to do away with the agent provocateur to make everything
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Vladimir held up his hand to a passing hansom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going in here,&rdquo; remarked the
Assistant Commissioner, looking at a building of noble
proportions and hospitable aspect, with the light of a great hall
falling through its glass doors on a broad flight of steps.</p>
<p>But Mr Vladimir, sitting, stony-eyed, inside the hansom, drove
off without a word.</p>
<p>The Assistant Commissioner himself did not turn into the noble
building.&nbsp; It was the Explorers&rsquo; Club.&nbsp; The
thought passed through his mind that Mr Vladimir, honorary
member, would not be seen very often there in the future.&nbsp;
